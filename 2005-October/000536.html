<PRE>Hi,

I just checked into svn my current state of the art changes.
There were a lot of changes I already talked about.
Note that I haven't tested any of the exports with my
changed (removed also some warnings). I have tested that
the export form works.

I have since over a week now a Mandriva 2006.0 based system
with gcc4.0 and other fine things. I still have to install
all those music systems to be able to further test the
export, printing and print preview. Still only abc is
completely implemented though I have neither tested with
my changes to export. I also bumped the library version
to 1.0.1.

As soon as I have done more tests and finished the rest
of the printing stuff I think I'm ready for release.

I don't think it is useful to start on scripting for the
current release as it will cost as too much time or it will
have only basic quality to start with.

So I'd release 8.0.1 with printing and as soon as we have
finished scripting and hopefully macro recording we can
release 8.1.0.

What do you think ?

Regards,

Reinhard
