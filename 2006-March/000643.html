NoteEdit is known to crash, when it tries to create a midi scheduler, if
no alsa devices are present. The bug is still there...

I'd advice you to translate as much as frequent terms as possible. Don't
stick to a few trickier translations and lose precious time on those -
write a simple translation (could be a bit longer, but means what it
should) - you'll improve your translation, if you'll have time after.
Know that you actually have all the time till the release (end of
April?). The deadline is only a recommendation for multiple people
translating the same translation in blocks, so they mainly finish until
the deadline and only proof-read after.
