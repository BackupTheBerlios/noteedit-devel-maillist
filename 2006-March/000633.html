<PRE>Hi,

As I wrote in the announcements for the beta release I worked
on scons files. I updated to the recent scons and noteedit can
again be compiled but installation is unchanged (i.e. incomplete).

The main issue remains midi.py. The tse3 library is detected fine
and I set the CXXFLAGS properly. But upon compiling the flags
are not added. I compared with other scripts and changed my own
script but still no luck (compare R416 to the current R431).

Searching for an example I browsed the scons/bksys homepage (the
scons_admin files are based upon bksys). I was quite astonished
to find out that there is no more bksys development. Instead the
author has started a new scons branch called waf. See
<A HREF="http://www.freehackers.org/~tnagy/bksys.html">http://www.freehackers.org/~tnagy/bksys.html</A> for details and reasons.

The KDE folks seem to have moved away currently from scons just
last month. They have migrated their projects to CMAKE for
various reasons. This is in my opinion a step back though cmake
has several advantages compared to bksys.

bksys/cmake is the framework (or build tool) similar to autoconf.
scons/make are the build systems to create the libraries and executables.

This of course puts me into a troublesome situation as I invested
so much time in scons (and still think it superiour from the
basic concept though it still need much time to mature).

To make the long story short, I will try somewhen in the not so
near future to work on a cmake port because I don't see a real
alternative (midi/tse3 is not supported by cmake similar as bksys).
There is a tool making migration from automake easier but a
FindTSE3 module I would have to develop myself (this is the hard
part).

Several reasons get me to do this:
- Testing how good cmake is in practice
- Hope that cmake makes it easier for people to port to windows
  (though automake/autoconf is not bad in this regard)
- Only build system except qmake with QT4 support (for Canorus).

Regards,

Reinhard
