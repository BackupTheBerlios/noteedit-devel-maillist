<PRE>Hi!

I have really big difficulties preparing the release.
One of them is scons (see separate mail on scons development).
The other are
- I have no idea how stable the noteedit trunk is. We have made many
  changes, even internal restructuring. My own code is quite useable.
- Changelog etc. is not quite up to date. Anyone having time should
  try to add missing items
- The release version needs to be set to 2.8.1 (partially done).
- NEWS file should contain the most important changes

I suffer much lack of time due to my music projects, preparation
on the LAC, Canorus of course etc. So if anyone can help me reducing
the huge load of things to be done before the beta release can be
put out, I'd be very thankful.

My main concern is the stability of the trunk. I admit I did no changes
to the stable tree, everything is on the trunk from me.
If we can't make a release from the trunk because of stability issues
I'm unable to promise a release in the next weeks.

I'm really sorry about all the issues, but I don't want to put out
something more unstable than the previous release.

As inbetween solution I suggest a alpha release from the trunk and hope
that some have time to test and compare against the current stable
version. These tests need of course time as well. I hope Georg and
Matevz can help me to find out the stability status of the trunk.

Regards,

Reinhard
