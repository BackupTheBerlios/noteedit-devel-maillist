<PRE>Hello to all.

I finally resolved multirest issues. They are now numbered correctly and 
their length is set according to the current time signature. I tried 
Lily export and it works fine. Measure numberings in NE are the same as 
Lily's. Note that inserting a multirest + key signature/clef + 
measureline works as well (my patch yesterday needed explicetly 
multirest + measureline in order to make measures numberings work). I 
also attached a screenshot of NE &amp; multirests in action.

I'm not sure if my patches were the best possible solutions to problems, 
but elementary they work this way:
- #3862 - measures after multirests not numbered correctly:
When placing a barline (of any type) NE now checks if any element of 
getType()==T_REST and getSubType()==MULTIREST exists in previous measure 
(an iterration until a measureline of any kind is found or the beginning 
of the document). If found, than place the measureLine with 
numbering+=lengthOfMultiRest (ie. the number of measures that mulitrest 
is long). If not, then make an ordanary measureline with numbering++.
- #3861 - Multirests in non-4/4 measure broken:
When placing a Multirest, its length_ variable (rest length in MIDI 
units) was set to voice-&gt;getStaff()-&gt;staff_props-&gt;getMeasureLength() 
multiplied by lengthOfMultiRest (number of measures). That would be 
fine, if getMeasureLength() would be properly set. But it was set to a 
constant 4*QUARTER_LENGTH. What I made was a new function 
NVoice::getCurrentMeasureMidiLength(), which tries to find the first 
time signature from that element backwards. It iterated until the time 
signature or the beginning of document was found. If found, it returned 
the correctly calculated measure length. If not found, it returned the 
default 4*QUARTER_LENGTH. Now, the getMeasureLength() is calculated by 
calling NVoice::getCurrentMeasureMidiLength() and is not set to a 
constant anymore.

What I'd like to know is if these patches are implemented correctly. Or 
are these functions and principles I took already implemented somewhere? 
In anyway, please test:-)


Regards.
