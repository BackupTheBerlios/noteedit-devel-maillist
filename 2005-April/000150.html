Ok, I cleaned my tree and redownloaded the current svn version and 
applied your patch. But when I invoked make -f Makefile.cvs, I get 
immediate error that libtool.m4.in is not found. When I renamed 
admin/old-* to admin/*, the error was fixed, but got another one:( :
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/noteedit-devel">matevz at mojazver</A>:~/apps/noteedit$ make -f Makefile.cvs
This Makefile is only for the CVS repository
This will be deleted before making the distribution

I didn't want to copy any other files from non-svn version anymore then. 
I unpatched the Makefile.am of your patch, but the error stayed. When 
KDevelop wanted to run automake &amp; friends, it returned the same errors 
(it just runs make -f Makefile.cvs?). Any other files/patches needed?
Using automake 1.8.5, make 3.0, g++ 3.3.5, kde 3.3.2, qt 3.3.4 and 
kdevelop 3.2.0, Debian unstable.

Regards.
