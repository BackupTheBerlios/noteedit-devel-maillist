<PRE>Hi Matev&#382;,

&gt;<i> Building from the svn subtree is still not functioning. Is there really 
</I>&gt;<i> a reason why we don't keep admin files from 2.7.4 version in the current 
</I>&gt;<i> trunk tree as well (as described in bug #2814)?
</I>
Not really for me, I just don't know how well they behave on other 
systems. I have managed to get all working with the current kde version
and created admin files with the help of kdevelop. But I had to patch
the noteedit/Makefile.am file to get things running properly.

Can some of you test, if everything runs well with the applied patch ?
If I don't apply the patch I can no longer build noteedit because
libtool does not correctly ignore some of the moc files.

Another issue for me is that the kdevelop project I created has the
problem that the uic (user interface compiler) doesn't get invoked.
make from the console works fine. Also the &quot;run automake and friends&quot;
does not work correctly, only running &quot;make -f Makefile.cvs&quot; manually 
seems to produce the correct configure file.
I have put my current kdevelop files to svn (Requires version 3.1.2). 
Maybe there is a bug in one of the options I changed or something 
different has to be changed to get things working correctly with kdevelop.

&gt;<i> ps. According to the bug discussion, KDE 2 support is IMO not needed 
</I>&gt;<i> anymore (J.A. recommended this more than a year ago?!). I'm currently 
</I>&gt;<i> aware of only Debian stable distribution, which still includes 2.2.2 
</I>&gt;<i> version of KDE (but it doesn't include NoteEdit package - available 
</I>&gt;<i> under testing/unstable only, which have KDE 3.3.2 currently).
</I>
I don't really think it is necessary as well. I already thought about
splitting the uiconnect.h/cpp files and making several ui.h files as
it is usually done for QT3 (so subclassing is only neets to be done when 
really needed).

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann
