Could you be more specific? I made a test with a treble clef long 2.5 
measures, then I placed a soprano clef in the middle of the third 
measure and continued writing in it. I saved, closed NE, open it again 
and it showed fine.

Yes, I noticed, but I don't think it's a bug, it's Lilypond's feature:). 
In NoteEdit, your composition is more technically correct:
For 4 measures, you write in treble clef. The fifth measure is in 
soprano clef. So you place the first element in the fifth measure the 
soprano clef (you closed the 4 measures long segment with a measureline 
and started a new segment in the fifth one). Placing the soprano clef as 
the last element in the fourth measure is nonsense, because a 
measureline doesn't depend on the clef (it doesn't have pitch, so it 
doesn't need it).

Lilypond tries to make the outlook nicer and more readable by the performer:
It ignores the exact position of the clef in .ly file (before or right 
after the measureline), but always places it before the measureline 
where the clef is about to change. Why is it good? Well, the performer 
register it more quickly. And besides it's quite common in literature (I 
checked my Henle's Chopin's Etudes and Edition Peters Czerny's Etudes) 
to place the new clef right before the measure where it changes and not 
in the measure measure itself. That's the LilyPond view.

IMO, this works as it should from the first place. Or did you have 
something else in mind?


Regards.
