<PRE>I fixed and updated the following bugs/areas:
- Do you want to save changes dialog, when hitting close button (in 
titlebar, not by File--&gt;Quit) ignored the Cancel hit. Therefore, if you 
made a change and quit by using the X button, NE asked you that you have 
unsaved changes, but if you hit cancel, it exited anyway. This is now fixed.
- When deleting an element and having the next element non-playable 
(measureline), NE didn't mark document as edited. Second, when selecting 
a region, and hitting Del key, NE ignored it. Only Backspace worked for 
deleting a region. Third, hitting Del or Backspace when no elements 
selected always marked document as non-edited (although you could make 
changes to the document before). Last but not least, I implemented a 
rule that if using Del key, it works only until you reach the end of 
document. This way, holding Del key won't delete the whole staff if you 
hold it too long. Backspace does though.
- Last bar numberings were wrong until at least version 2.7.1. Last bar 
number was always one ahead than actual bar number (the endbar number). 
This way, Edit--&gt;Goto bar option always showed you the last bar number 
increased by one. This was because bar numberings used barNr_++ and not 
++barNr_, whereas the initial value of barNr_ should be 1 and not 2. 
This works now as it should.
- One click MIDI import implemented using File--&gt;Import--&gt;MIDI import. 
It's actually only a shortcut to TSE3--&gt;MIDI In and 
TSE3--&gt;TSE3toDocument. If all goes well, it brings you a nice notice 
that you should use Edit--&gt;Autobar &amp; Autobeam and other tools for making 
score nicer or you should take a look in documentation for further 
details. The downside is that it uses the TSE3 score for MIDI import. So 
if you already have any scores currently loaded in TSE3, it will be 
lost. I also updated the .po files to include this notice.

Please test and report any spotted bugs:). I think NE is mature for a 
new release? (2.7.5)


Best wishes!
