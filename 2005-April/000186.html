&gt;<i>Hi Matev&#382;,

</I>&gt;<i>a look through your patches gave me confidence that things are working

</I>&gt;<i>multirests the time coming. Btw., recently I tried to fix #3503 (abc
</I>&gt;<i>export bug), because I thought I could do it, but got stucked. Maybe a
</I>&gt;<i>search backwards like you did it for multirest would give me there a
</I>&gt;<i>solution.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Ugh. I hate this kind of bugs, mostly because of weak NoteEdit structure 
:<i>(. I didn't dig into the bug though, but I persume that NoteEdit 
</I>doesn't have a function that would return you the notes that are in 
timing above the current, in other voice (chord). You could then seek 
the previous element of every first-voice note (above the current one) 
and if this element is a measureline or similar, then the measureline 
should be before the current note as well.
The other way I'd prefer more, is that measurelines of any kind should 
be written in non-first voices as well. This would easily resolve RFE (I 
don't remember the number), which suggested writing measurelines in 
non-first voices as well.
All in all, everything above should require a thought or two thoughts 
more:). I hope you have some better ideas than I do in the moment!

&gt;<i>I did in the meantime some little cleaning, just things I stumbled over
</I>&gt;<i>recently:
</I>&gt;<i>-- A few printf's for midi-debugging are disabled. They could overflow
</I>&gt;<i>the KDE-console (relevant when startet from a desktop icon) that
</I>&gt;<i>noteedit would crash after a long and heavy session.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>That's great.

&gt;<i>-- In lilyexport text markups go now without \fattext, so texts by
</I>&gt;<i>default will not influence the horizontal spacing of notes. This is what
</I>&gt;<i>I we most of the time want, I think.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, that's fine IMO. Although NE shows FatText all the time in UI.

&gt;<i>-- The tie (~) is written before the octaviation command, so lilypond
</I>&gt;<i>will not choke on this anymore.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I have a feeling that NEWS file is getting mature for the new release:).
