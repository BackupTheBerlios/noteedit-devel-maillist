Subject: [Noteedit-devel] shadow note draw function
Message-ID: <422B760E.4080504@guest.arnes.si>

I'm trying to find a function that draws the shadow whole note (the 
place where you're about to place a note) on mouseMove event. I'm 
looking in NStaffLayout class in noteedit/layout.h or .cpp but cannot 
seem to find it (this is the main canvas in the main window where the 
whole score is drawn, right?).

I'm trying to resolve RFE #556 (show current pitch in other staves too)

Woops, sorry. NStaffLayout doesn't have connection with the main widget 
score canvas. Digging further ...
btw. Is there any documentation of the code or are those few comments 
every 500 lines all that it is?

No good news ...

As far as I know, no up-to-date design documentation for NoteEdit exists. 
Whenever I change some code, I also add function headers to everything I 
touch, but it will be a lot of work to get consistent and complete 
documentation.

Took me about a year to start to understand most parts :-(.

Regards, Leon.

Message-ID: <422EDE15.1040502@schwaben.de>

Hi all,

I'm passing this mail I've got over the list, because i'ts valuable 
input, and the best expert of us should adress it. (My addition: The 
Suse 9.2 noteedit-2.7.3.diff has a lot of icon path patches in it we 
might consider and incorporate if they make common sense.)

-------------  snipp ------------

Hi there,

I really like Noteedit, but there has been an omission over
the last few versions that is bothering me.

The "make install" never copies the noteedit.png program
icon into the $PREFIX/share/icons/ hierarchy.  Instead, all
of your icons are under $PREFIX/share/apps/noteedit/icons/,
which is fine for the "local" Noteedit icons, but not for
the one "noteedit.png" icon that needs to be available globally.

The KDE desktop entry noteedit.desktop references "icon =
noteedit", but that icon cannot be found.  Therefore,
Noteedit always appears in my Utilities menu without an
icon, even though you guys have made a nice icon for it.

Can the installer be fixed for this simple issue?

Thanks,

Ken Zalewski

------------------------------

Hi again,

I have a second issue that I want to address.  The TSE3
library is completely out-of-date with respect to current
versions of ALSA.  If anyone is running ALSA 1.0.x (which
many of us are, when using kernel 2.6.x), then TSE3 will
simply not build properly any longer, since it contains
explicit checks for ALSA 0.5.x or ALSA 0.9.x:

ie.  return SND_LIB_MINOR != 5 && SND_LIB_MINOR != 9;

in the configure script.

If you want your project to continue using an unsupported
library, then I suggest you take over the library and make a
current, buildable version available from your own site.

The TSE3 site is no longer being updated, and it's been 2
years since a new version of TSE3 was released.  In
addition, version 0.2.7 has one nasty compilation bug that
prevents ALSA support from being enabled, even if ALSA 0.9.x
is being used.  (I reported this to the TSE3 developer 2
years ago...  no response.)

Thanks,

Ken Zalewski

As I had to do this the last time I buily from source, I should be a able to 
generate a patch fixing these issues without too much trouble. I could upload 
that to the web site. Give me a few days, please.

Wouldn't object if another volunteer appears, but if I don't hear from anyone 
I'll do it this weekend.

Regards, Leon.

Hi all,

please find attached two patches for TSE3 0.2.7. The first one allows TSE3's 
configure to also recognize and support ALSA 1.0. The second one fixes the 
compilation errors, which, I believe, were introduced with GCC 3.4.

The build procedure

- unzip tse3-0.2.7.tar.gz
- cd tse3-0.2.7
- patch -p1 <tse3-0.2.7-patch-alsa1.0
- patch -p1 <tse3-0.2.7-patch-gcc3.4
- ./configure
- make

now results in a clean build on Fedora Core 3.
Note: configure will be regenerated at start of make, don't know why.

Georg, could you store these patches somewhere on berliOS ?

Best regards, Leon.

I contacted the official (obiously not active anymore) maintainer of
NoteEdit for Debian 14 day ago and got no reply. So I contacted the
official QA Debian mailing list today and got the following reply.
Hope we'll see a new version in Debian soon (the current one is 2.7.1).

I have two small suggestions/RFEs (I was about to submit them to
noteedit berlios project page, but is currently offline):
1) When using TSE3->TSE3 --> Score option, it should ask you if you're
sure to overwrite the current score with the TSE3 song. Now, it only
overwrites everything without notice and there's no undo for that.
2) Using File->Import MIDI ... should be a shortcut to TSE3->MIDI in
and TSE3->TSE3 --> Score. Currently it shows you the obsolete dialog
(using old url to the documentation) how to import MIDI using TSE3 and
does nothing.

Hi Matev?,

your proposal is now in svn, thanks. I spent some time to put this 
dialog in the translation pool, but didn't get a good hold, so feel free 
to help in this area. I remember also a mail on the list with an jpeg of 
garbled strings of the about dialog, which is, I think, a problem of the 
same area. The report was with french menus set up.

Thanks for taking attention to the RFEs. For me the TSE3 generation is 
also puzzling like some postings state it in the RFEs section. And there 
are also really cool ideas :)

Best Regards,
Georg

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Howto: Create PDF / HTML Documentation
Message-ID: <424C4904.4070507@web.de>

Hi!

I just wanted to let you know how you can create a html and even
a pdf/ps documentation from the index.docbook file.

If you want to create the german version of the documentation
you need to copy the german index.docbook from the doc/de into the
doc/noteedit directory.

Now change to the doc/noteedit directory.

Call "meinproc index.docbook"
This creates several html files from the docbook file.

You can now watch the documentation with
<favourite browser> index.html

To create a PDF file you need htmldoc.

I use the user interface for creating the doc, but it can be
done via command line as well. As this is easy I leave it as
exercise to the reader ;-)

Input: Select all html files from the file requester
Sort the html files like in the table of content from the index.html file
index.html file is the title file.
Output: PDF
Page: Page Size (A4)

I encountered 5 table errors when "Generate"ing the document.
The result is a 134 (german version) long pdf file. The table
of contents is currently twice present, one of them could be
omitted.

See appendix (of the mail, not of the documentation ;-)
for the noteedit.book htmldoc file.
