What exactly wents wrong when you try to build noteedit ?
You don't need to specify any options. If you have installed
the libtse3 devel files (oldlily option is only needed, if
Fedora Core 3 does use a quite old version of lilypond) usually
the build should work flawlessly. You could also try the configure
files delivered with the current release.

Concerning kdevelop: You only need to  import the noteedit files into a 
new project (this can be even done with svn, though I haven't tried it).
The project type has to be a "KDE C++ Application (automake based)."

I have no deep insight in the automake process but I'd recommand to
first try old version of automake (1.4) before trying a more recent version.

I would like to mention here that the Suse 9.2 noteedit.spec- and 
-.diff-File might help here. I managed only per rpmbuild 
../noteedit.spec to build it on my x86-64. Once on Suse 9.0 
configuration worked out of the noteedit sources according to the docu 
within, without using rpmbuild.

(With this built noteedit I checked whiteangels submitted patch, which 
looks ok. I like it. If I now only knew to install in parallel lilipond 
2.0.3 for production purposes. convert-ly fails for me on quite a few 
files. noteedit has to catch up with lilypond again ...)

Regards,
Georg.

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Bug #2528 Triplets unfunctional
Message-ID: <HNEXFE09a27ynSGrnXc00012424@hnexfe09.hetnet.nl>

Hi all,

bug 2528 (Triplets unfunctional) seems like an interesting problem to solve, 
so I am volunteering to (try to) fix it. In case anyone else is already 
working on it, please let me know, to prevent duplicate effort. Note: from 
working on the MusicXML interface I am already reasonably familiar with 
NoteEdit's data structures.

Before I start I'd like to check if I understand the requirement correctly: I 
assume the idea is that if the triplet button is active while entering a 
group of notes, triplets are formed automatically. The sequence of actions 
would then be:
enter notes
press triplet button
enter notes
press (deactivate) triplet button
enter notes

The second group of notes would be turned into a triplet if possible. This 
should automatically happen as soon as the last note of the group is entered. 
The first and third group would not be triplets.

Furthermore I assume that the current behaviour (enter notes, select group, 
press triplet button) should also remain functional.

Would the bug submitter please confirm, deny and/or clarify this ?

Best regards, Leon.

Hi Reinhard,

summary of problems attached below, part(s) of your mail deleted for brevity. 
Please note that I will not be able to work on NoteEdit for the next week, so 
I won't be able to test things quickly.

Regards, Leon.

What I do is simply take the source tree exactly as it is in svn and then run 
"make -f Makefile.cvs", "./configure" and "make". Shortened (i.e. many lines 
of similar errors deleted) transcript is attached below. If it helps, I could 
send the whole transcript in a text file. Lines started with "..." and "->" 
are my comments.

Finally one remark, in order to support our current users, who may be using 
old software (such as "old lily"), I think we should try to keep existing 
build-time configuration options intact for as much as reasonably possible. 
Simply removing these options would force our users to upgrade, which may or 
may not be feasible.

Hi all,

see title. Please give it a test drive and report any issues to me.

Triplets can now be inserted by pressing the triplet key and entering three 
notes of the same length. Note that this leaves the last of the three notes 
selected (red). Depressing the triplet key will break the triplet as long as 
this note is selected. Thus, first deselect the last note (e.g. by clicking 
anywhere outside of the staff) before depressing the triplet button.

Regards, Leon.

Hello Leon,

thanks a lot for this fix. It works beautifully.

A small issue I would like to mention: With time values and beams I'm 
used in insert mode to choose in advance. To match this behavior I felt 
that it would be better to leave the last triplet in place when 
depressing 3, even when the last note is still selected. In edit mode 
opening up the triplet I would expect. It might be a matter of habits, I 
will just use it and get used to it more.

Regards, Georg

Hi Georg,

thanks for your reply. I do agree with you on not breaking the tuplet when 
depressing the button. The current behaviour is strange anyway, as you have 
to select three notes to create a triplet, but select a single note to break 
it. I will change the button depress behaviour to leave the triplet intact.

Please note that the fix is still incomplete, I would also want to build a 
triplet when entering two notes of values that can form a triplet (1/4 + 1/8 
etc.), remove the debugging code and update the documentation (english 
version only, leaving the german translation to someone else !) accordingly.

I'm not sure how to handle edit mode, will have a look at that.

Best regards, Leon.

Georg,

after looking at the triplet code for some time, I came to the conclusion 
that simply not breaking the triplet when the triplet button is depressed 
(after entering the third triplet note) will not be feasible.

Currently there is only one way to break a triplet, and that is to select one 
of the triplet notes and depress the triplet button. Simply disabling the 
"break triplet" function in this way would leave us without any possibility 
to break a triplet.

The current behaviour for the similar actions make/break beam, slur and 
triplet is:

beam handling:
make: mark block, press beam button
break: select any of the beamed notes, depress beam button

slur handling:
make: mark block, press triplet button
break: select the first slurred note, depress slur button

triplet handling:
make: mark block, press triplet button
break: select any of the triplet notes, depress triplet button

note: neither break is influenced by edit mode

Possible solutions could be:

- 1) don't change anything (keep the behaviour as is in CVS right now)
- 2) break the triplet only when the first note is selected and the button is 
depressed (thus being consistent with slur behaviour and fixing your problem, 
same change should then also be made for beams)
- 3) break the tuplet only when the whole group is selected (by pressing left 
mouse button and dragging), which is consistent with the way you create a 
triplet

I believe the third option is least preferable, as it requires too much use 
of the mouse. We should probably do either 1) or 2).

Please let me know how you feel we should handle this. I would also like to 
hear from the other readers of this list. Until I have received feedback 
about this, I won't make any behavioural changes.

Regards, Leon.

Currently, a way to break a beam is to insert any note or rest inside an 
already made beam as well. That's a bigger problem I think. Making beams 
should should stay the way it is now. But breaking should be only 
available the way you wrote above, but not by inserting notes as well.

>slur handling:
>make: mark block, press triplet button

>

Making a slur is ok. Breaking it is a bit wierd though. I think it's 
nonsense to necesserily select the first note and then undo the slur. 
You should be anywhere in the current slur and should be able to delete 
the slur by simply pressing the slur button. Anyway, slurs are never 
nested, so my option is the most feasible IMO.

Making triplets is cool. Breaking them is fine as well IMO. If you 
insert a note into an already made triplet, the triplet breaks, which is 
correct IMO.

First of all, slur, triplet and beam buttons (which reflect the current 
slur/triplet/beam status of the note) should be updated every time you 
select a note. I think the option 1) is the most feasible for triplets. 
I think fixing the slur and beam code is more useful.

Hi Leon, hi all,

I feel I could easily get mixed up with the input modes we have in 
noteedit. To avoid that let me please try to clarify: We have three 
distinct modes:
e) edit mode, E icon is on
s) select mode, arrow icon is on, or at least no note value on
i) insert mode, a note value icon is on

In mode e things are working okay, you come to this mode only later when 
correcting.

Mode s is for navigation, to choose where to start insertions, is 
usefull at the beginning of input.

Mode i is for hopefully fast input of music. In this mode I sit with the 
left hand at the computer keyboard to preselect the time value, slur and 
punktuation, and the right hand hits then the midi keyboard or left 
mouse button for the note :-)  In this mode I enjoy the new working 
triplet insertion! Leon, this differs from your description of triplet 
handling.

"mark block" is something I don't want to do in the first place. It's 
too slow. I want to insert notes, slurs and beams, and so on, fluently 
without selecting a block. In mode i the left mouse will always make a 
new note, errors are corrected with backspace, so watch it:). With slurs 
that works, which I prefer as the model of completing triplet insertion. 
I only see now, that beams always need mode s or e, which should be 
fixed (I rarely used them). Leon, do you see things also like this, and 
are your thoughts about the inner workings of the code and the 
feasability still valid? At least for me the description should became 
clear.

I'm afraid different philosophies collide here. I would formulate like 
this :)
In mode e slur, triplet and beam buttons reflect the current state of 
the selected note.
In mode i slur, triplet and beam buttons reflect the current state of 
the next to be inserted note.
In mode s I don't know, maybe like mode e, better don't care.

And slurs seem to work okay for me, beams need fixing in mode i, only 
mode i needs fixing ...

1) is the best choice of the presented ones.

As another topic: Maybe it helps, and I never saw music not following 
this: We could state as restriction: 8-th triplets can only start at the 
beginning of a quarter in an equally quarter-devided bar, and so on.

And this: How can I make a local copy of the repository to take it with 
my notebook and use svn diff offline to follow you better?

Best Regards,
Georg.

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Bug 2528 fixed
Message-ID: <HNEXFE07p4XgWZGbRkp00051c46@hnexfe07.hetnet.nl>

Hi all,

After the mail discussion about the user interface changes for bug #2528, I 
decided not to change it, simply because no workable solution was found.

The triplet is still broken when the button is depressed while the last note 
is selected. Sorry, Georg.

I did remove my debug code, added the possibility to make two note triplets 
(e.g. 1/4 + 1/8) the same way and updated the English manual. I now consider 
bug 2528 closed.

For other user interface changes, please file feature requests or bug reports 
and I will see what can be done.

Note: I will be on vacation for almost two weeks.

Happy newyear.

Leon.

Hi all,

as promised I changed the manual, README etc. to reflect the fact that Joerg 
Anders stopped maintaining NoteEdit and that the new home is on berliOS.

Feel free to make changes, additions etc.

Georg, Reinhard: could any of you please update the german manual as well ?

Best regards, Leon.
