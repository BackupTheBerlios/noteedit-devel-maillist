</I>&gt;<i> Reinhard,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) I see you managed to release 2.8.0 these days. I would like to
</I>&gt;<i> remind you to make a copy of the released 2.8.0 version into
</I>&gt;<i> /tags/2.8.0 in our SVN repository.
</I>
Ok, somewhen when I have time again...

&gt;<i> 2) I played downloaded&amp;compiled&amp;installed Qt4.0. I like it so far, but
</I>&gt;<i> wasn't able to make much with NoteEdit yet (configure doesn't find
</I>&gt;<i> it?!?). Can you say anything about your plans, when and how are you
</I>&gt;<i> going to migrate to Qt4.0? We'd have to update our configure to work
</I>&gt;<i> properly (or maybe even rewrite it completely?), remove code in #if
</I>&gt;<i> QT_VERSION &lt;300 block, make changes to fit a new Qt API and announce
</I>&gt;<i> that NoteEdit 2.9 requires now Qt &gt;= 300.
</I>
I haven't thought about it and I probably won't start thinking about
it until Noteedit 2.8.1 has been released. Scripting and the printing
dialog are the main features needed by NoteEdit in the near future IMO.
I want to wait for that until my distribution officially includes QT4
in some form (that will probably happen in late autumn, end of october
or so). Basically I would drop Qt 3.x support completely as there is
a QT3.x backward compatibility interface in Qt4 and because the 
differences are to large for maintaining backward compatibility. I
also don't think we will se an unstable release this year except we
some developers having more time than me to work on it.

&gt;<i> 3) I tried compiling NoteEdit with gcc-4.0, but had no luck. I fixed
</I>&gt;<i> the configure script and it works fine. The problem is that it cannot
</I>&gt;<i> compile TSE3 headers (MANY syntax errors like the wrong use of
</I>&gt;<i> type-def, friend classes, templates etc.!). I contacted Pete and I
</I>&gt;<i> hope he'll manage to release a gcc4-compatible version asap. I don't
</I>&gt;<i> think Debian is going to accept our program without being gcc4-compatible.
</I>
gcc4.0 is in Cooker for Mandriva and I won't switch to it until the
next version of Mandriva is released (maybe if I have time I'll test
the release candidate for Mandriva somewhen in September/October).
I think all other distribution will switch to gcc4 before Debian
will officially start to use it (i.e. at least in testing).

I hoped to manage more than the homepage update an the release
itself but the Linux Info Tag here in Pforzheim where I'm doing
the Linux audio booth alone took too much preparation time (and
still will be incomplete, so I have to improvise a bit). I will
present NoteEdit there as well though I don't think that we will
get a new developer from that day. Maybe I can spend an hour on NoteEdit
on sunday if there is no work left from saturday. The following
week I'll have to prepare for the next concert, so again only
very few time left.

I'm very satisfied with the work and the plans you do and hope
that end of july I be able start working on NoteEdit again on a
more regular base.

Regards,

Reinhard
