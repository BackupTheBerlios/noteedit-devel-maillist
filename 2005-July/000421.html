<PRE>Hi Csaba,

&gt;<i> NClef::midi2Line is buggy 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I've tried to correct midi2Line, but I wasn't succeeded. 
</I>&gt;<i> A method is missing from NKeySig, which gives back whether 
</I>&gt;<i> the specific line has b,# mark or not. 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Excuse me to tell this, but the code of NKeySig is terrible with lots of bugs. 
</I>&gt;<i> Rewrite is necessary.  
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> It brokes totally the object oriented technique. 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> - methods with names that tells nothing 
</I>&gt;<i> - methods which logically belongs to totally different objects 
</I>&gt;<i> - no comments at all 
</I>&gt;<i> - functions, local variables that does nothing 
</I>
I think that is a one of the darks parts in NoteEdit history
I really don't know anything about...

&gt;<i> If nobody has objection, I would rewrite that code gradually, 
</I>&gt;<i> trying to understand what the author originally meant. 
</I>
That really sound good to me! Myself I mainly work on the
user interface avoiding touching the interior as far as
as possible ;-)

&gt;<i> The rewrite may cause new bugs, but if it become much more 
</I>&gt;<i> understandable, the development later can be much more faster... 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> In which development phase are you in? 
</I>&gt;<i> - developing, or bug hunting (code freeze),... 
</I>
We have two trees: A stable and a unstable tree. Currently
we are doing all changes in both trees, i.e. we concentrate
on bugfixing and still adding some useful features. We have
planned to do major changed in late autumn.

&gt;<i> Do you have a CHANGELOG in which changes could be logged? 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>
Currently SVN and the berlios project page is our Changelog.
But all changes we do are written into the NEWS file (one
line for a bugfix or an enhancement).

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann
