I think you should read more about the LilyPond project (or other free
engraving software like ABC music). The project is mature, it's very
complex and it has history (Lily was known as Gnutella a long time
ago). Engraving and notation were in past very respectful jobs.
LilyPond project studied the note engraving science and they tend to
make an engraving engine that offers a unique look of the score as it
would have been made by hand. LilyPond with its syntax is today the
de-facto standard for music publishing as LaTeX is for publishing the
technical literature and Docbook for application documentation.

If we are to make OOo compatibility/plugin, I don't think we should
make a new engraving engine from scratch by ourselves. I would rather
automate the NoteEdit&lt;-&gt;OOo via LilyPond process as possible.

Also, our plan for 2.8.1 is to remake and automate the printing
procedures. In short, we're going to automate the export to Lily/ABC,
compilation of the exported file to pdf and calling a printing/viewing
application for that document. In the future, LilyPond for example is
taking some interesting new frontends (eg. Guile and LilyPad), which
render the written syntax on-the-fly. They even allow you to grab
certain elements and move them around freely, to fine-tune the look of
the score. So in the even farther future when these projects get
mature, NoteEdit is probably going to call them upon the current score.

Note that these are my thoughts and visions only. I don't want you to
lose any interest in your goal. I just don't want you to rush and
double the work that has already been done up there.

&gt;<i> The OpenOffice.org 2.0 Draw file format is a zip file containing
</I>&gt;<i> XML files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These XML files contain lines, texts, bitmaps,... It's similar to
</I>&gt;<i> the windows metafile (WMF).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All I have to do is to create a new Paint Engine, which collects
</I>&gt;<i> the drawing shapes from QPainter and stores it in odg (The
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOffice 2.0 Draw format). It's easier, than I expected.
</I>
Keep in mind that this way you won't get vector graphics out of it for
note heads, clefs and other non-linear objects (look at
noteedit/resources for the source images). Using an external engraver
will produce any vector file you want. Also, OOo is written in GTK as
far as I know. Or not?

&gt;<i> Drawbacks of my solution: - QPaintEngine is defined in QT 4.0,
</I>&gt;<i> which requires at least KDE 4 - The odg file format requires at
</I>&gt;<i> least OpenOffice 2.0
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't suggest to keep the compatibility with KDE 3.x, and OOo
</I>&gt;<i> 1.x, as it makes the solution much harder. Conditional compilation
</I>&gt;<i> can be used, till everybody will use at least KDE 4.x.
</I>
Our plan is not to sustain compatibility with KDE at all in the
future. We are to migrate to Qt4-only. This way, we'll break the KDE
dependency (easier to maintain Qt4 only) and achieve better
portability. As for OOo, I think the 2.0 is going to become a standard
soon and 1.1.5 will support odg file format as well afaik.

I told before I was thinking about this idea a few months ago. I
thought that OOo can do the texts, sheets, presentations, drawings and
databases. What it lacks is a 3D modeller and a music score editor.
Now LilyPond offers a tool called lily-book which works hand-to-hand
with LaTeX. You actually write the whole book in TeX and only place
blocks of code in Lily syntax where you wish a musical example to take
place. When compiling the book then, LaTeX automatically calls
LilyPond for compilation of the music elements where the Lily syntax
block is found. For myself, that seemed to be too complex (not
everyone is familiar with LaTeX?!?) and I was thinking about an easier
way to write a document in eg. OOo and then to include some musical
examples produced by LilyPond (but not by hand like exporting an
example to .ly, importing the produced png/svg file and then update it
every time when something changes etc.).

I'm wondering, why do you wish to implement an OpenOffice.org
in&#359;eroperability with NoteEdit?
