<PRE>Excuse me. The order of my two mails were changed. 
When I wrote that mail, I didn't read your LilyPond related suggestion.

Anyway, let's postpone this OpenOffice issue. 
I should learn a lot about your code, before writing my first line into the 
code. It may take some time. I didn't think, that noteedit is longer than 
60000 lines...

So instead of developing, I'll play with it, and collect the necessary 
information.

Best regards,

    Csaba

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It would be a nice add-on feature though we currently concentrate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; on two different things: Improving printing usability and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; integrating a scripting engine into NoteEdit. Most other things
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; (except lilypond export enhancement for the 2.6 version) are bug
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; fixes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thank you for the answer. Yes, printing is really the most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; important thing to do. To tell the truth, printing and exporting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into OOo should use the same code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think you should read more about the LilyPond project (or other free
</I>&gt;<i> engraving software like ABC music). The project is mature, it's very
</I>&gt;<i> complex and it has history (Lily was known as Gnutella a long time
</I>&gt;<i> ago). Engraving and notation were in past very respectful jobs.
</I>&gt;<i> LilyPond project studied the note engraving science and they tend to
</I>&gt;<i> make an engraving engine that offers a unique look of the score as it
</I>&gt;<i> would have been made by hand. LilyPond with its syntax is today the
</I>&gt;<i> de-facto standard for music publishing as LaTeX is for publishing the
</I>&gt;<i> technical literature and Docbook for application documentation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If we are to make OOo compatibility/plugin, I don't think we should
</I>&gt;<i> make a new engraving engine from scratch by ourselves. I would 
</I>rather
&gt;<i> automate the NoteEdit&lt;-&gt;OOo via LilyPond process as possible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, our plan for 2.8.1 is to remake and automate the printing
</I>&gt;<i> procedures. In short, we're going to automate the export to Lily/ABC,
</I>&gt;<i> compilation of the exported file to pdf and calling a printing/viewing
</I>&gt;<i> application for that document. In the future, LilyPond for example is
</I>&gt;<i> taking some interesting new frontends (eg. Guile and LilyPad), which
</I>&gt;<i> render the written syntax on-the-fly. They even allow you to grab
</I>&gt;<i> certain elements and move them around freely, to fine-tune the look 
</I>of
&gt;<i> the score. So in the even farther future when these projects get
</I>&gt;<i> mature, NoteEdit is probably going to call them upon the current 
</I>score.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that these are my thoughts and visions only. I don't want you to
</I>&gt;<i> lose any interest in your goal. I just don't want you to rush and
</I>&gt;<i> double the work that has already been done up there.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The OpenOffice.org 2.0 Draw file format is a zip file containing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; XML files.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; These XML files contain lines, texts, bitmaps,... It's similar to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the windows metafile (WMF).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; All I have to do is to create a new Paint Engine, which collects
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the drawing shapes from QPainter and stores it in odg (The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OpenOffice 2.0 Draw format). It's easier, than I expected.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Keep in mind that this way you won't get vector graphics out of it for
</I>&gt;<i> note heads, clefs and other non-linear objects (look at
</I>&gt;<i> noteedit/resources for the source images). Using an external 
</I>engraver
&gt;<i> will produce any vector file you want. Also, OOo is written in GTK as
</I>&gt;<i> far as I know. Or not?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Drawbacks of my solution: - QPaintEngine is defined in QT 4.0,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which requires at least KDE 4 - The odg file format requires at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; least OpenOffice 2.0
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't suggest to keep the compatibility with KDE 3.x, and OOo
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1.x, as it makes the solution much harder. Conditional compilation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can be used, till everybody will use at least KDE 4.x.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Our plan is not to sustain compatibility with KDE at all in the
</I>&gt;<i> future. We are to migrate to Qt4-only. This way, we'll break the KDE
</I>&gt;<i> dependency (easier to maintain Qt4 only) and achieve better
</I>&gt;<i> portability. As for OOo, I think the 2.0 is going to become a standard
</I>&gt;<i> soon and 1.1.5 will support odg file format as well afaik.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I told before I was thinking about this idea a few months ago. I
</I>&gt;<i> thought that OOo can do the texts, sheets, presentations, drawings 
</I>and
&gt;<i> databases. What it lacks is a 3D modeller and a music score editor.
</I>&gt;<i> Now LilyPond offers a tool called lily-book which works hand-to-hand
</I>&gt;<i> with LaTeX. You actually write the whole book in TeX and only place
</I>&gt;<i> blocks of code in Lily syntax where you wish a musical example to 
</I>take
&gt;<i> place. When compiling the book then, LaTeX automatically calls
</I>&gt;<i> LilyPond for compilation of the music elements where the Lily syntax
</I>&gt;<i> block is found. For myself, that seemed to be too complex (not
</I>&gt;<i> everyone is familiar with LaTeX?!?) and I was thinking about an easier
</I>&gt;<i> way to write a document in eg. OOo and then to include some musical
</I>&gt;<i> examples produced by LilyPond (but not by hand like exporting an
</I>&gt;<i> example to .ly, importing the produced png/svg file and then update it
</I>&gt;<i> every time when something changes etc.).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm wondering, why do you wish to implement an OpenOffice.org
</I>&gt;<i> interoperability with NoteEdit?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards!
