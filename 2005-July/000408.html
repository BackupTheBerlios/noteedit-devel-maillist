&gt;<i> Hi! I've some questions...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. What is the main reason that the user cannot edit the bar lines
</I>&gt;<i> directly?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've found a short key '|', but it doesn't really work. Buggy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have scores which has no specific time signature, it changes from
</I>&gt;<i> bar to bar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As bar lines can be deleted, but one cannot create new one, this
</I>&gt;<i> makes hard to correct it.
</I>
For placing a barline, the TAB key is used. For repeat barlines, one
of the three kinds in the toolbar has to be selected and then placed
in the score. For the final barline, an option from menu has to be
chosen. For setting a N-time repeat, you first have to place a repeat
bar and then Edit-&gt;Set N-time repeat.

Using a pipe (|) key is IMO not needed anymore and will be removed in
future. About the non-metrum music, I commited a patch that doesn't do
automatic placement of barlines and similar if no metrum is defined.
It should work properly as I tested.

&gt;<i> 2. Does NoteEdit support software MIDI sequencers, such as
</I>&gt;<i> timidity?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've installed linux onto 7-8 different computers, but the hardware
</I>&gt;<i> MIDI sequencer only worked on 2 of them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Was it my fault, or just ALSA doesn't support most of the MIDI
</I>&gt;<i> sequencers?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I start timidity as a background process, it works, but most of
</I>&gt;<i> the users has no idea how to do it...
</I>
I myself run Timidity in background (I have a cheap integrated VIA
sound chipset on my laptop). Under Debian, all I had to do is to
install timidity and commented out ENABLE=1 line in
/etc/init.d/timidity so it starts as a server on startup every time I
turn the computer on. I think there's not much NoteEdit can do here.
It could run the timidity server when NoteEdit starts automatically,
but it couldn't run it in realtime high-priority mode as it's not run
by root (the startup script is).

&gt;<i> 3. If I use 'keyboard mode' and press ENTER, nothing happens. The
</I>&gt;<i> documentation says that a note should be inserted...
</I>
Hm... it works for me. I simply activate the Insert from Keyboard mode
(a big A letter on a button on the blue backroung without a glue) and
then I use up/down arrows for selecting the pitch and ENTER to place
the actual note.

&gt;<i> 4. The page settings for export are not saved in the .not file. The
</I>&gt;<i> user has to fill the dialog up every time, he/she restarts
</I>&gt;<i> noteedit.
</I>
True. That's one thing that needs to be included in the new NoteEdit
file format. The problem at the moment is that NoteEdit actually
cannot store any special values than most of the current ones as the
.not file is MUP-compatible and doesn't offer all the features
NoteEdit does.
