<PRE>Hi Matev&#382;,

the reason for having the voice mapper is to be able to easily assign the 
minimum number of voices necessary. As you probably know, a MusicXML part may 
contain more than one staff (typical example: piano music, two staves). The 
voice numbers are, however, unique for the part, not for the staff. This 
means that for a piano part with two voices in both treble and bass staff, 
the voices will be numbered 1 up through 4 (1 and 2 on the treble staff, 3 
and 4 on the bass staff).

The voicemapper implementation makes it easy to assign only two voices to both 
NoteEdit staves created. This is the behaviour as it is in the 2.8.0 release, 
which I would consider correct. Your implementation correctly assigns two 
voices to the treble staff, but (incorrectly, IMHO) assigns four voices to 
the bass staff. Two of the four voices are completely empty.

Normally stem direction should not be an issue on importing, as well-behaving 
MusicXML implementations should write explicit stem directions. Importing 
MusicXML files without explicit stem direction should be the exception, not 
the rule.

Summarizing, I think the removal of the voicemapper usage and the 1:1 NE and 
MusicXML voice assignment is not a good idea. It doesn't solve any real 
problem but creates unnecessary empty voices. Please revert to the original 
impementation.

In case of further questions don't hesitate to contact me, either on 
noteedit-devel or via private email (address is in the source files).

Best regards, Leon.
