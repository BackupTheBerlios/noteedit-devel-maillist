<PRE>Hi Matev&#382;,

&gt;<i> Hi Karai!

</I>&gt;<i> I think myself and the entire development team appreciate all the

</I>&gt;<i> confident to actually do the reorganization stuff. But I'm trying to
</I>&gt;<i> beat that:).
</I>
I can only second your thoughts! Myself I didn't look very deep into
the internals as the program is quite large and complex. But reading
the ML and trying to figure out some code places already showed me
that there is room for enhancement (especially comments).

If I had more time I would try to create some overview documentation
over the code so that it is easier for new developers to get their/our
ideas implemented. That what I had in my mind since NoteEdit was
moved to Berlios. Up to now I only created a doxygen documentation
with several picture. There is one very large picture showing all
classes but it's not the simple overview I had in my mind.

&gt;<i> Btw. Can you prefer any advanced C++ programming and project management
</I>&gt;<i> books or resources (which covers something like NoteEdit and other
</I>&gt;<i> GNU-based projects). I really think I should read more about the things
</I>&gt;<i> how they should be done in common practice - I get the feeling just too
</I>&gt;<i> many times that I improvize or &quot;heat the already warm water&quot; (or how
</I>&gt;<i> it's said in English:)).
</I>
Well I had many recommendation for Design with the book &quot;Effectice C++&quot;.
This one covers the basic program design matters, and an second one
&quot;More Effective C++&quot; the more advanced themes. Also the STL (Standard
Templace Library) is covered in an extra book. General design books
concerning software projects should be based on UML-2. I have two
books, but they are both in german (basics and advanced topics).
Maybe UML-2-Toolkit is a book for you if you want to learn more
about software analysis and design. The UML-Bible on the contrary
is a book covering everything about UML, for those who want to get
an UML expert. I want to buy a new book less covering UML itself but
concentrating on the software design process. Maybe the book
&quot;Object-Oriented Analysis and Design : Understanding System Development 
with UML 2.0&quot; helps you if you want to take a similar approach.
And finally you might be interested in Interface design books...

&gt;<i> I see you made a new entry in our development Wiki. I read it through
</I>&gt;<i> today and I'm quite impressed. The changes and new strcuture reminds me
</I>&gt;<i> on the Qt library on times, but I think it's, as I said before, probably
</I>&gt;<i> more a standard for Object oriented programming (the new casting methods).
</I>
Yes I agree, also the Qt book by the Qt authors is really worth a read.

Best regards,

Reinhard
