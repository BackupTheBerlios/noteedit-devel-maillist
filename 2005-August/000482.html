</I>Basso continuo is what everyone used until approx. 1750 to play a bass on 
organ, harpsichord, theorbo, cello etc. etc. For example Bach wrote for all 
cantates a continuo line and not a written out harpsichord part in 2 keys 
like all modern editions. It looks like a single bass line with numbers below 
it. One expected from the player (especially before Bach, like all French 
baroque, Monteverdi, etc. etc.) that he or she knew what kind of chord and 
scale one had to play, so very often even the numbers are missing. A continuo 
part is very free and more like a jazz tune: one has to improvise to make it 
nice. The numbers indicate what kind of chord to play on the note, a little 
bit like guitar chords. So, it's a combination of numbers: 6, 7, #, B (moll) 
etc. sometimes more difficult like 6\n4# 7\n4\n3 (2 resp 3 numbers with or 
without # below eachother).
So I presume it should be put in a separate stave or in a lyric way or this 
guitar extension way. Don't know yet.

I'll first have a look into the code and perhaps I can help with getting a few 
things on paper how everythings works together with some doxygen tags as a 
start.
Taco
