<PRE>Hi Karai!

I think myself and the entire development team appreciate all the
efforts you made the last bunch of commits about reorganizing NoteEdit's
internals. My thoughts are the same - NoteEdit needs much reorganization
of the current code, so there will be space for tons of new major
features and enhancements we have in mind. I was thinking many times
about the base code and a way to improve some organization stuff (along
with configure/make). But unfortunately, I'm not so skilled and self
confident to actually do the reorganization stuff. But I'm trying to
beat that:).

Btw. Can you prefer any advanced C++ programming and project management
books or resources (which covers something like NoteEdit and other
GNU-based projects). I really think I should read more about the things
how they should be done in common practice - I get the feeling just too
many times that I improvize or &quot;heat the already warm water&quot; (or how
it's said in English:)).

I see you made a new entry in our development Wiki. I read it through
today and I'm quite impressed. The changes and new strcuture reminds me
on the Qt library on times, but I think it's, as I said before, probably
more a standard for Object oriented programming (the new casting methods).

If you have time, maybe you could visit the private development forum at
Berlios and give a word or two about yourself. Anyway, keep up the good
work!


Best wishes!
- Matev&#382;
