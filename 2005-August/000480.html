<PRE>To tell the truth, the reorganizing steps changed the majority of the code. I don't think, that I made serious bugs, but I cannot grant it. Changing the internals is a painful thing.
 
Unfortunately the reorganization is not yet finished. Similar steps should be done for increasing the understandability.

I know that it's nearly impossible to develop, when the internals are always changing, and because of that, I WON'T DO MORE REORGANIZING STEPS for some time.

Excuse me for the temporary instability, I caused in the code. I gladly help in stabilizing the code again.

Before making the next similar reorganizing steps, I'll ask permission on the mailing list. The instability cannot be avoided after making such a big changes.

Excuse me again for the inconveniencies,

Best regards,

Csaba

&gt;<i>I try to remove as many methods from NMusElement as possible by

</I>Hi Csaba,

basically I agree with you, and I surfed webcsv to look a little bit
what you are doing. I think, even in a big reorganisation, the project
should build and run, maybe have a serious bug here or there not more
than three days.

I did a few checkouts these days. Only yesterday I recognized that
exporting to lilypond gives faulty results, and today it even crashes with

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00002aaaaac73dd6 in NChord::countOfLyricsLines () from
/opt/kde3/lib64/libnoteedit.so.1
(gdb)

Maybe you know easily what's wrong. Nevertheless, today I'll try to
debug this more, before I go to a one week vacation. ABC export is
working well, also XML import/export.

That's it for now,
Regards,
Georg
