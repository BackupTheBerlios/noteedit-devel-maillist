<PRE>Thanks for the kind words. I was a bit afraid, that my work will cause 
lots of troubles, because of the very big changes.

Some words about my plan:

The music elements should be placed into a linked list, which have
'next' and 'prev' methods and inherits from QObject. This would be the
base of the new architecture. 

If an element requires the clef for example, just walks through the
'prev' methods, till finds it. 

If a new Clef is inserted, clefChanged(NClef *) signal will be emitted
for all affected items in the linked list (the clefs are cached).

With an architecture like that, quite high code separation could be
reached.

The current architecture is very very far from it. That's why I wrote,
that it requires half year or more to finish.

Bye,

    Csaba

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Karai!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think myself and the entire development team appreciate all the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; efforts you made the last bunch of commits about reorganizing NoteEdit's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; internals. My thoughts are the same - NoteEdit needs much reorganization
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the current code, so there will be space for tons of new major
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; features and enhancements we have in mind. I was thinking many times
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about the base code and a way to improve some organization stuff (along
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with configure/make). But unfortunately, I'm not so skilled and self
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; confident to actually do the reorganization stuff. But I'm trying to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; beat that:).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can only second your thoughts! Myself I didn't look very deep into
</I>&gt;<i> the internals as the program is quite large and complex. But reading
</I>&gt;<i> the ML and trying to figure out some code places already showed me
</I>&gt;<i> that there is room for enhancement (especially comments).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If I had more time I would try to create some overview documentation
</I>&gt;<i> over the code so that it is easier for new developers to get their/our
</I>&gt;<i> ideas implemented. That what I had in my mind since NoteEdit was
</I>&gt;<i> moved to Berlios. Up to now I only created a doxygen documentation
</I>&gt;<i> with several picture. There is one very large picture showing all
</I>&gt;<i> classes but it's not the simple overview I had in my mind.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Btw. Can you prefer any advanced C++ programming and project management
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; books or resources (which covers something like NoteEdit and other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GNU-based projects). I really think I should read more about the things
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how they should be done in common practice - I get the feeling just too
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; many times that I improvize or &quot;heat the already warm water&quot; (or how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's said in English:)).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well I had many recommendation for Design with the book &quot;Effectice C++&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> This one covers the basic program design matters, and an second one
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;More Effective C++&quot; the more advanced themes. Also the STL (Standard
</I>&gt;<i> Templace Library) is covered in an extra book. General design books
</I>&gt;<i> concerning software projects should be based on UML-2. I have two
</I>&gt;<i> books, but they are both in german (basics and advanced topics).
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe UML-2-Toolkit is a book for you if you want to learn more
</I>&gt;<i> about software analysis and design. The UML-Bible on the contrary
</I>&gt;<i> is a book covering everything about UML, for those who want to get
</I>&gt;<i> an UML expert. I want to buy a new book less covering UML itself but
</I>&gt;<i> concentrating on the software design process. Maybe the book
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Object-Oriented Analysis and Design : Understanding System Development 
</I>&gt;<i> with UML 2.0&quot; helps you if you want to take a similar approach.
</I>&gt;<i> And finally you might be interested in Interface design books...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I see you made a new entry in our development Wiki. I read it through
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; today and I'm quite impressed. The changes and new strcuture reminds me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on the Qt library on times, but I think it's, as I said before, probably
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more a standard for Object oriented programming (the new casting methods).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes I agree, also the Qt book by the Qt authors is really worth a read.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Reinhard
