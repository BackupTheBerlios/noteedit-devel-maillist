<PRE>Hi Leon!

I'm digging through the changes I made and found out the reason, why I
made the 1:1 voice numbers in the first place. The problem occured, if I
wanted to import a score, where the non-first voice started (and the
first voice had rests (hidden) until it entered). An example is a
baroque fugue, where first the 2nd voice starts, then the 1st and later
the 3rd. Also, many choir examples can be found, where altos first enter
and sopranos after them.

Now, the way NoteEdit imported these kinds of files before, was to
assign a new voice in xml file to the first available new voice in
NoteEdit. This way, 2nd voice became the first one, first voice became
the second one in the above mentioned examples and so on. You can
imagine the mess with stem directions and other voice number related
stuff that happened then.

Now, to combine both funcionalities, I'd suggest the following:
1) import the voice numbers as they were prior to R272 (via voicemapper)
2) add a new function that sorts the voices as they're sorted in xml file.
3) this way voice numbers 4,5,6 in xml file will be imported as voices
1,2,3, no matter which one starts first.

I'm trying to implement this now. Comments and better ideas are always
welcome:-)?


Regards.
