Subject: [Noteedit-devel] [ANN] NoteEdit 2.8.1 released
Message-ID: <44DE03ED.50206@web.de>

Hi,

The NoteEdit team is happy to announce the long awaited new release
of the score editor NoteEdit.

You can directly fetch the sources from here:
http://download.berlios.de/noteedit/noteedit-2.8.1.tar.gz

Please note:
This is the last major release on NoteEdit. Since some month the core team
concentrates it's development on the NoteEdit successor called Canorus.
More information can be found here:
http://canorus.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Main_Page

The new version 2.8.1 contains the following major changes since the
last release:

- New direct printing and print preview support using different backends:
  - Implemented custom print dialog.
  - New settings in Configure dialog for printing.
  - Custom preview application (eg. kpdf, gpdf, xpdf, gv).
  - Custom typesetting application (LilyPond, ABC, PMX/MusiXTeX).
- Enhanced UI:
  - mouse wheel behaviour improvements (zoom in/out, quick scroll, vertical
  scroll),
  - added keyboard shortcuts (select n-th voice directly, start/stop
playback,
  insert special barline, goto measure),
  - few dialog improvements (insert clef or barline, page layout),
  - new dialog: Insert special barline.
  - remember the last position of action (useful when deleting the whole
block
  of the score),
  - rewritten scroll behaviour (especially when the selected element is
  out-of-scope),
  - red border when Edit mode is active.
  - added vertical line which connects all staves
- MusicXML improvements:
  - import arbitrary text.
  - export arbitrary text.
  - export all strings in UTF-8 encoding.
- LilyPond export filter improvements:
  - arranger is now exported.
  - document page size is exported.
  - rit./accel. signs are printed in italic.
  - export all strings in UTF-8 encoding, if Lily >2.6 is found.
  - official Lilypond font sizes are now supported
- gcc4 complete compiler support. Many warning fixes and internal cleanups.
- Many documentation additions and fixes.
- New translations and translation updates

More details (including bug fixes and detailed changes) can be found
in the NEWS file and the ChangeLog file of the archive.

The reasons for stopping major development on NoteEdit were discussed
on the NoteEdit development mailing list some time ago. You can read
the thread here:

Message-ID: <44DF8DCC.1040902@web.de>

Hi,

Just some minutes ago I checked in my last changes to
the toolbar code. It should be relatively flexible now for
many applications of toolbar requirements. It supports

- Button menus
- Normal menus
- Combo Box (easier to code than for normal toolbar)
- Normal tool buttons (dito)

With additional changes to the main window Canorus
can now change it's clef and it's note length. Matevz
so far has implemented breve, whole, half and quarter,
more to follow soon.

Best,

Reinhard

Hi there, Reinhard,

I'd like to know which language Note-Edit is written
in, since I'm managing to learn C++ programming, and,
following my musician career, I'm looking forward in
building a free and open source musical score editing
software. If Note-Edit is in the same language, I'd
like to contribute to it, because I don't believe we
have a perfectly functional program of the same kind.
By the way, the ones I know (Sibelius and Finale, the
big ones and most used) are too buggy, expensive and
do not offer great compatibility with file types.

Now, sorry to express myself in these words, by I'm
really annoyed at the lack of great programs of this
kind for the musicians, so I'd like to do my part in
giving the musicians something they can rely on to
write musical scores, as a universal language between
us.

Well, hope to hear from you, and take care,

Diogo Baeder - bass player

Hi,

When doing configure on 2.8.1 final, without options, configure cannot
find the qt-mt library. When I give it the right location

--with-qt-libraries=/usr/lib/qt3/lib64/

it does find qt-mt allright, but now it complaints that

checking for KDE... configure: error:
in the prefix, you've chosen, are no KDE libraries installed. This will
fail.
So, check this please and use another prefix!

Indeed the KDE-libs are not in the same place, (they are in
/opt/kde3/lib64/kde3) but why is that a problem? There seems to be no
way - at least, I don't see it - to explicitly give the location of the
KDE-libs to configure.

My system is Suse 10.1 AMD-64 on a dual-proc Opteron.

Thanks for an answer (and, of course, for the software, which I use
frequently on a 32-bits Suse 10.0 box!).

regards, Jogchum Reitsma

NoteEdit itself is written in C++. The same answer
for it's successor Canorus. Contrary to NoteEdit some
parts of Canorus will rely on scripts (macros). These are
preferably also written in an object-oriented scripting
language like Ruby.

Wow, that would be great. I just yesterday asked on Berlios for new
developers:
http://devcounter.berlios.de/req_show.php?reqid=79

You see that there is quite a bit work to do on Canorus.
If you want to join the team, you need to send me your unix name
on berlios so I can add you to the developer list.
We are quite a bit concerned about file types. One main goal is to
have as many importers and exporters as possible (like lilypond,
abc(plus), musicxml, musixtex, midi).

As an introduction what we planned so far in detail for Canorus

My research wasn't directly connected to timing, I know it from
general experience and from my study. I looked for the script
languages and found ruby to be advanced over python in terms
of language concepts. About an hour ago I discussed with
Matevz about package delivery (i.e. on Win we need to include
ruby or python as well). Generally I've done some research in
tools (see the wiki, btw. you have an account there as well, the
default password is the same as your username but the first and
last latter are large. Please change it ASAP.

Welcome as developer from Canorus :-) The Wiki contains several
informations about concepts and goals, a roadmap and what we
plan to have (at least) ready for the 1.0 version. I have to update
somewhen soon what we have already (or partially) implemented.

I'm not a real MusicXML expert, but XML generally
is expandable of course. But we have to be aware of
the fact that any extensions might be only useful in
Canorus itself if it won't get included into a new version
of the MusicXML standard.

Yes, both Canorus and Muse score use it the way that
they render vector fonts. Matevz knows more details
about it (you can take a look at the source of course too :)

Oh that remembers me on my first journal articles
about user interface development in a computer magazine
(quite good one from my actual experience point of view).
It pointed out the importance of color, shades and contrast.
As we are heading for music art this would really be a nice
touch. So be creative and show some examples. I have to
upload the homepages to svn but you should be able to
access it from your berlios shell account.

Thanks for the feedback!

Best,

Reinhard

Hi, guys,

Sorry for the hurry, I've got a harmony class now, but
here goes some draft idea, just for a start, without
specifical touches, for the site. It's sent through
attachment.

I'll write more soon, maybe today by the evening (from
here, in Brazil). By the way, where are you guys from?

Thanks for the design proposal, I like it! Only one small problem:
There is a limit on the font size I can choose, else the section
titles become larger than the border.

Matevz also finds it ok and said that the content update
possibilities (like simplifying the addition of news or new
downloads) are more important at the moment. I also think
we should update the pages themselves quite soon. Thanks
for the effort!

Best,

Reinhard

Yes, I received it, but up to know I haven't discussed with
Matevz about a possible use in Canorus. Thanks anyway.
I don't remember at the moment what we exactly discussed
concerning midi instruments but it certainly will be different
to that what NoteEdit offers now. There is a very good sound
font editor named swami and there are other things to consider
like alternatives to midi output (like osc / open sound control)
and of course alternatives to GM (General Midi). This topic was
discussed on the LAC conference this year as well but at the
moment no such thing like f.e. a container or something similar
exists. I guess in the short run the componist should be able to
select from some known instrument list (like GM) and be somehow
able to include his own custom lists (created by a tool like swami).

This is of course open to discussion :-).
The LAC proceedings (swami and ) can be found here:
http://lac.zkm.de/2006/proceedings.shtml#josh_green

If anyone has some informations about existing (open source)
solutions in development or ready feel free to inform us. Thanks!
