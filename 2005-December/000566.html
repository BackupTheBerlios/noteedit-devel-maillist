<PRE>Hi,

I hope you all had a nice christmas eve and holidays. A little bit late
I have a present for you: NoteEdit scons project administration.

I've created scons files for NoteEdit. I want to move away from automake
tools (less dependency, less hassle with dependencies). scons supports
QT, I used bksys kde.py (actually kde.py from KDE svn fixing several
bugs like translation). I wrote a midi.py for TSE3 / kmid support and
added printing options to general.py (see scons_admin directory).

Building is simple: Just invoke scons without any parameters from
the 'trunk' directory. If you want to manually configure just  call
'scons configure' and the relevant options (Use scons -h to see the
options like debug=full). If you only want to build something in a
subdirectory do it this way: 'cd &lt;subdir&gt;; scons -u'.

To build and install NoteEdit with scons simply use 'scons install'.
You can also invoke 'scons' install as root after building it.

scons creates a cache and retrieves files from the cache if you delete
them manually. Manually this can be switched off with --no-cache.

The SConstruct is the main scons file residing in the main directory.
doc, kguitar_excerpt, noteedit have their own SConscript files being
invoked by SConstruct (env.BuildDir, env.subdirs).

On my system currently libnotedit.* is installed into the kde directory
and no longer into the $KDEDIR/lib directory. (that could be
/usr/lib/kde3 or /opt/kde/lib). This happends because I use kobject
from kde.py for creating the shared / static library and not the
official scons way (ToDo).

I haven't tested everything. There could be a problem with a missing
config.h file (either uncomment the corresponding line in the referenced
file and send problems afterwards to the list or copy config.h from
a different place). Also installation doesn't seem to install the
icons (at least I haven't wrote anything for these extra files only
needing to be installed but not to be build).

I use scons 0.96.1. I've seen that newer versions of scons are
available. I think it would be good to be able to reduce the cache
size used by scons (i.e. implicit --cache-disable). I can't recommand
the implicit cache as it seems to make the cache grow continuously.
Here you are free to make your own experiments.

Best regards

Reinhard
