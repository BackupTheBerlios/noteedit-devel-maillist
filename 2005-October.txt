Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Printing partially checked into SVB
Message-ID: <4342D9D5.9080304@web.de>

Hi,

Some parts of my printing code are now in SVN. The printing settings
are available and can be changed. The printing menu points are available
but do still execute the old code until I can check in my prininting code.

I have fought with one issue: reparenting. This really doesn't work
and is also discouraged according to the Qt documentation. It concerns
the printing dialog page adding the selected export tab to the dialog.
I will change it in a way so I can simply create a new "tab" for the
printing dialog.

This requires to do changes I already wanted to do
with the export dialog:
- Create export forms for each export format (done)
- Expand uiconnect.h / uiconnect.cpp so it integrates the new export 
forms (done)
- New methods in uiconnect to access the options from the export form
   (set and get options, set is currently not needed but a nice 
enhancement for the future, maybe saving the current options in the 
noteedit file itself replacing the "Output params" (Save params tab)).
(work in progress)
- Change all export classes to use the new get options (work in progress)
- Change printing code to use the new export forms and adapt the
Printing Dialog page class to integrate the forms instead of
reparenting them
- Fininsh printing code for other print formats (abc printing
is nearly finished by now).

When everything works I plan to do the following:
- Remove printing code from mainframewidget.cpp and create an own
class for it
- Make ExportFrm as a separate file (currently in uiconnect)

Regards,

Reinhard

Hi,


yes, this was the number. I merged branches/code_cleanup to trunk, and
put on it Patch #627 (Update Qt Collection Class names and #include's)
from Henri Manson. To work more on code_cleanup needs probably syncing.

Best Regards,
Georg.

a remark: Without enabling it won't compile, so you need

    --with-printing

at configure time. Probably when finished it will be enabled
automatically, I guess.

Thank you VERY VERY MUCH.

Unfortunately I have only few time and I wanted to do the merge today.
It's so good to hear that you've done it.

Thank you again!

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Qt UI spacing
Message-ID: <434A9567.5020308@guest.arnes.si>

Hi!

I have a question about widgets spacing in Qt:
We have many translations in NoteEdit and some are shorter, the others
are longer etc. Is it possible, to define a dynamic width of a widget
(label, button, text box), to fit the context of that widget. I'm
looking at "MIDI information line:" sign at MIDI export dialog. I'd like
to change it to "Additional MIDI export parameters:", but in Slovenian,
there is something like "Dodatne MIDI nastavitve:" and I would like the
label itself being long as the sign is and that the QLineEdit widget
right next to it fits closely to the label's right border. Is it
possible & does anybody has any experience with this kind of
problems/solutions?


Regards.
- Matev?

Hi Matevz,

I already have worked on the export layout and solved the
problem you had. It's relatively simple: The export layout currently
does not use any layouts. I changed them in a way so all forms
now have it's layout. You still have to be patient for the
change though as there are quite some things to change. I have
finished implementing of ABC and Lilypond. So "only" 4 left to do.
(every format requires me to investigate the parameters read from
within the export module and to create a structure for them as
well as implement the set and get methods).

Layouts are easily created: Load the form in the designed, click
on one of the tabs and press (f.e.) "Layout in a group".

Regards,

Reinhard

Thanks.

I knew there's something with Layouts stuff for this kind of UIs (it's
the same as Java's Swing), but wasn't sure how Qt is doing this exactly.
It works like a charm now on the example I tried:).

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] State printing / export
Message-ID: <435D5382.6040908@web.de>

Hi,

I just checked into svn my current state of the art changes.
There were a lot of changes I already talked about.
Note that I haven't tested any of the exports with my
changed (removed also some warnings). I have tested that
the export form works.

I have since over a week now a Mandriva 2006.0 based system
with gcc4.0 and other fine things. I still have to install
all those music systems to be able to further test the
export, printing and print preview. Still only abc is
completely implemented though I have neither tested with
my changes to export. I also bumped the library version
to 1.0.1.

As soon as I have done more tests and finished the rest
of the printing stuff I think I'm ready for release.

I don't think it is useful to start on scripting for the
current release as it will cost as too much time or it will
have only basic quality to start with.

So I'd release 8.0.1 with printing and as soon as we have
finished scripting and hopefully macro recording we can
release 8.1.0.

What do you think ?

Regards,

Reinhard

Hi Reinhard,

things seem still to work! Thanks! I'm here on gcc 3.3.5 and whatever
glibc, so I needed the attatched patch. I'm not shure if I should cast
to double. Could you decide?

Nevertheless, I'm looking forward to the new release with the new
printing feature, gcc4 support and all the other goodies.
Regards,
Georg.

Hi there,

I have a question regardint TSE3 dependency. In the documentation it says 
somewhere that TSE3 dependency can be turned off but it doesn't say how. If I 
just want to use noteedit really for editing (no playback or whatever) then I 
don't need TSE3, right?

Thanks,

Yes, check ./configure --help for more information. I think ./configure
--without-libtse3 should do the trick.

ps. Why do you want to turn off TSE3? If you have playback troubles (no
working MIDI controller), try --nooss and --noalsa parameters first,
because NoteEdit losses many import/export capabilities without libtse3.

Hi Reinhard!

I'd like to fix some more beaming issues till the release (2 bugs -
Another beaming of already beamed notes result sometimes in crash,
Autobeam in non-first voice doesn't work) and maybe improve our MusicXML
import (import of tuplets) and export (rythm in non-first-two voices is
completely messed up). But then, I'd go for the release!

What did you mean by 8.0.1??!? You mean NoteEdit 2.8.1? (or did we
change the versioning policy)

Ups, I guess I was too tired when I wrote this mail. Of course I mean
2.8.1, well I guess a 2.8.0.1 does not make any sense ;-). So 2.8.2
will hopefully be the first release including scripting support.
Of course some fixes should be included to the release, especially
the bug concerning abc export having worked on 2.7.x.

Regards,

Reinhard

Hmm thanks for the patch but I haven't changed the file you
mentioned. Maybe it was due to some other changes ?
Concerning your questions: As fabs takes double as parameter
you have to convert it to double.

Regards,

Reinhard

Hi Karai and others!

If I open a new document, place two different key signatures one by
another and delete the first one, I get a crash. There is a segmentation
fault in Keysig.cpp @ line 435.

The crash appeared in R317 (ckarai):
FIXED: problem with natural keys before the KeySig

The problem is that if I place a simple if (previousKeySig_) return;
sentence before the loop, there's no crash, but the second key signature
isn't correctly updated (the naturals that eliminate the previous keysig
accidentals aren't cleared).

Could any of you (Karai?) properly resolve this issue? I'm currently
digging in the beaming code and found this bug accidently;).


Regards.

I meant if (!previousKeySig_) return;

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] User interface and viewport cleanups
Message-ID: <43667BB5.90502@guest.arnes.si>

Hello all.

I've been polishing and implementing some stuff I've been thinking about
them for some time. Revisions 381 and 382 bring some interesting stuff like:
- ALT + mouse scroll - fast scroll (10 times)
- SHIFT + mouse scroll - vertical scroll
- ALT + SHIFT + mouse scroll - fast vertical scroll (5 times)
- CTRL + mouse scroll - zoom in/out
- when using right/left keys for cycling through elements, the viewport
is panned left/right/up/down in order to properly display the currently
selected element
- zooming keeps the top-left coordinate of the viewport
- vertical scroll range is now properly aligned from the most
top-element to the most-bottom one.
- some internal changes and cleanups

For more info, check the ChangeLog.

Some issues for the next revisions:
- insert from keyboard mode should correctly align mouse pointer to the
right/left side of the note. 2 bugs:
  - it isn't aware of brace/bracket at the beginning of the score, so
everything is shifted for some pixels to the left
  - when cycling through elements in this mode, you should first change
the direction and then move to the next/prev element

Some interesting RFEs I'm thinking about:
- Non-hardcoded zoom
- Fit to height
- Fit to width
- Rewrite the playback code, so you'd be able to look freely around the
score, while NE is playing.

Please tell me what you think!


Regards.
