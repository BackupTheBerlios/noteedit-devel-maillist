Hi,

I finally found the reason why preview print and export did
not work correctly and also fixed some other related problems.

Hi Reinhard,

nice, preview is now working for me. It makes proof reading easier,
getting this multiline display. Ofcourse, a bug to report: When I start
preview a second time, with the first xpdf or gv still left open,
NoteEdit is blocked, has to be killed. I guess you find a solution ...

Thanks, Regards,

As a side note: I had to remove my

to get rid of reproducable crashes when switching from gv to kpdf in the
preview program setting.

Hi,

I justed added a new shortcut for breve (idea from the lilypond ML).

Hello list,

I'm Takeshi Hamasaki from Japan.
I subscribed to this ML just few minutes ago.

I placed a ja.po file for NoteEdit 2.8.1 at:
http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA014481/team-ja/noteedit-2.8.1.ja.po

Now its status is: 
357 translated messages, 9 fuzzy translations, 590 untranslated messages.

according to the output from msgfmt.
Yes, it is far way to complete, I think it is better than nothing.
I'll work to increase the translated messages day by day 
and replace ja.po file at same URL.

I'm happy if this ja.po is included in release.

Thanks,

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Bug lilypond export with many voices in one staff
Message-ID: <200605060125.42724.Stefan-Hackl@gmx.de>

Hello,

First of all I would like to thank all developers! Noteedit is a fantastic 
program! Especially the latest beta with the direct print option. 

I would like to contribute but I don't know much about programming, so I 
thought I could help with bug reports. 

I spent a lot of time getting known to lilypond and detected three bugs in the 
lilypond export of noteedit. I think it won't be a big thing fixing them:

1. Two staves can be joined in different ways:
a) with a brace on the left and connected bar-lines (export works perfectly)
b) with a bracket on the left and connected bar-lines (BUG: bar-lines not 
connected!)  --> "StaffGroup" is the correct identifier for this, while 
Noteedit creates a "ChoirStaff"
c) with a bracket on the left and seperate bar-lines (export works perfectly)
d) without bracket on the left and seperate bar-lines (export works perfectly)

See Lilypond-Documentation:
http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.8/Documentation/user/lilypond/System-start-delimiters.html#System-start-delimiters

2. Instrument names are exported incorrectly for polyphonic staves. 
A simple Example:
This is a fragment of the Lilypond export file

GitarreXBAVoiceA = \relative c' {
	\voiceOne 
	\clef G
	\time 4/4 
	                   
	e'4 e d f 
	\bar "|."
}
GitarreXBAVoiceB = \relative c' {
	\voiceTwo 
	\partial 1
	                   
	e2 d 
}
GitarreXBA = \simultaneous {
	\set Staff.instrument = #"Gitarre 1 "
	\context Voice="GitarreXBAVoiceA" \GitarreXBAVoiceA
	\context Voice="GitarreXBAVoiceB" \GitarreXBAVoiceB
}

In order to make the instrument name visible in the lilypond output file the 
command  \set Staff.instrument = #"Gitarre 1 " should be added in the first 
voice part:

GitarreXBAVoiceA = \relative c' {
	\voiceOne 
	\clef G
	\time 4/4 
	\set Staff.instrument = #"Gitarre 1 "
	                   
	e'4 e d f 
	\bar "|."
}
GitarreXBAVoiceB = \relative c' {
	\voiceTwo 
	\partial 1
	                   
	e2 d 
}
GitarreXBA = \simultaneous {
	\context Voice="GitarreXBAVoiceA" \GitarreXBAVoiceA
	\context Voice="GitarreXBAVoiceB" \GitarreXBAVoiceB
}


3. For vocal music with two or more stanzas the  \set stanza = "1."  ,  \set 
stanza = "2." , ... line should be added within the  \lyricmode { ... } part. 
Otherwise the stanza number will not be visible.

Example:

StimmeATextA = \lyricmode { \set stanza = "1." 
		
		
		
		
		So troll'n wir uns ganz 
		fromm und sacht von Wein- ge- lag und 
		Freu- den- schmaus, wenn uns der Tod sagt: 
		''Gu- te Nacht, dein Stun- den-  _ glas rinnt 
		aus!'' Wer heut noch frech den 
		Schna- bel wetzt und glaubt ein gro- ?er 
		Herr zu sein, pa? auf der Schrei- ner 
		ho- belt jetzt schon grad an  _ dei- nem 
		Schrein. Scheint das Grab dir tief und 
		dumpf sein Druck, A- la- vott, so nimm noch 
		ei- nen Schluck und noch ei- nen hin- ter- her und noch 
		zwei, drei mehr, dann stirbst  _ du  _ nicht  _ so  _ 
		schwer. 
		
		
		}
StimmeATextB = \lyricmode { \set stanza = "2." 
		
		
		
		
		Der nach des an- dern 
		Lieb- ster schielt und doch sich f?hlt als 
		No- bel- mann. Pa? auf! Dem Spiel- mann 
		der dir spielt springst du ins  _ Grab vo- 
		ran. Und du, der toll vor 
		Ei- fer- sucht zer- schmi? einst je- des 
		Glas im Saal. Wenn dich der Tod im 
		Bett be- sucht, hoch le- be  _ dein Ri- 
		val. Scheint das Grab dir tief und 
		dumpf sein Druck, A- la- vott, so nimm noch 
		ei- nen Schluck! Und noch ei- nen gleich da- bei und noch 
		zwei oder drei, dann stirbst  _ du  _ sor-  _ gen-  _ 
		frei. 
		
		
		}


I am using Lilypond 2.8.1. may be some of this problems were not present with 
Lily 2.6.x, but running convert-ly doesn't fix them.

If you cannot understand anythind in this mail, I can write in german, it 
seems there are xome german developers.

Stefan Hackl

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Lilypond lyric export
Message-ID: <200605060146.07264.Stefan-Hackl@gmx.de>

Hello again,

Lyrics in Lilypond look better if hyphenation (german: "Silbentrennung)  is 
written with a double dash and a space charakter after the word: " --"

Example:
 
                So troll'n wir uns ganz 
                fromm und sacht von Wein -- ge -- lag und 
                Freu -- den -- schmaus, wenn uns der Tod sagt: 
                ''Gu -- te Nacht, dein Stun -- den -- glas rinnt 
                aus!'' 

If it is written this way, lilypond will create a centered hyphen (german: 
"Trennungsstrich"), which looks better than a hyphen sticking to one word 
part.

Best Regards,

Stefan

This works for me. \set stanza = "1." is in the score block below in
\context lyrics {}.

Yes it is, but with Lilypond 2.8.1. it seems to be the wrong position. If I 
run lilypond with the file the stanza number doesn't apear.

Yes, NoteEdit doesn't support more advanced hyphens. It uses a simple -
after the first word to mark that it's not complete. It supports
multiple sillables per note using < and > signs though.

I cannot reproduce the other two: I'm using LilyPond 2.8.1 and export
from NE works fine.

I'm attaching the example. Could you be more specific?

Hello,

Thank you for your efforts!
I attach an example file for you. In this file instrument name of second staff 
and stanza numbers are missing. 

In the file "corrected-version.ly" the problem doesn't appear.

Stefan

Hi all,

in R460 it's fixed, please test. The stanza number is now at the
beginning of lyrics, not at the beginning of the score. I like this
better now, too :)

I'm on lily 2.6.5, and it behaves like 2.8.1 I conclude.

Regards,
Georg

Hi again!

I fixed this in R462. It should export instrument name for multi-voice
staff too now. Please test...

Hi Stefan.

More advanced hyphens and melismas (hyphen, when the word is already
finished) are now implemented in R462. If you put a simple - after the
word, it's now interpreted as " --" and LilyPond uses it as a real
hyphen. Moreover, I also implemented melismas - if you put _ righr after
the note, melisma (underline) is drawn until it ends. For the notes,
where the hyphen/melisma line should be, you can use a simple - or _ per
note too.


Regards.

Tanks for the improvements. As a regression test i run all examples in
trunk/noteedit/examples through lilypond 2.6.5 by print preview, and got
lilypond choking with these:

    example3, example7, example9, fugue_no1.

Is the experience with lilypond 2.8.1 the same? Upgrading to lilypond
2.8.1 for me looks very tedious, so I backed out this for the moment.
Probably it doesn't matter either. I think our examples should render
with the recent lilyponds, and fixing probably is not too difficult.

With example4 the words get shifted, so in this Matev? maybe you should
have a look?

Best Regards,
Georg

Message-ID: <4460CDD7.9070901@guest.arnes.si>

Hello to all.

I made many Lily additions lately. It's too much to describe. Briefly, I
added:
- Hyphens and Melisma support for lyrics
- New drum note support for rectangle note - diamond
- Support for different drum notes in a singal chord - requires Lily 2.8.x.
- Some smaller fixes.

Now, the exported document look almost perfect! The new direct printing
function is getting more and more useful :)
Please test - thoroughly! Example4 looks fine now btw.

Regards.
- Matev?

Hi,

Line is inserted when push left button of mouse, not middle, after selecting
a line from Insert --> Line.

Description in Today's Tips:
   <b>...that you can insert lines?</b><br/><br/>\n
   Select <code>Insert --&gt; lines</code>, choose a line and middle click\ton\n
   a note.\n

Should I open a bug for this on bug tracking system on Berlios.de?
I found it during testing 2.8.1-beta1 and translating message catalog 
into Japanese.

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Previewprint updates
Message-ID: <44658E89.10507@web.de>

Hi,

I checked in my latest changes to previewprint:
ADDED: previewprint::setupPrinting returns whether setup was successfull
or not and checks if preview is still running
FIXED: create preview process only if it wasn't created already
FIXED: print/preview: stop if preview is still running
FIXED: delete form_ in IntPrinter destructor (does not remove the
dialogpage though -- might lead to crashes!)

In the past deleting the form_ in the IntPrinter destructor lead to
crashes on my system, but then the
code was still quite different from now. So if after printing NoteEdit
crashes, simply comment the
delete line in previewprint.cpp line 764.

Also with the changes on setupPrinting you only get one dialog after
pressing "Cancel". I hope to find
a possibility to find out why setup printing failed so the error message
is only shown for real problems.

Regards,

Reinhard

Thanks,
I updated ja.po .

The file is placed at
  http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA014481/team-ja/noteedit-2.8.1.ja.po

Now its statistics from msgfmt is:
  762 translated messages, 14 fuzzy translations, 185 untranslated messages.

The pace of translation process is going to slow down or even once stop
since it requires more knowledge of music staff writing than now I have.
So it is good time to take the file in subversion tree, I think.

Message-ID: <4467674E.3040408@web.de>

Hi,

Again some changes to the preview print code:
- ADDED: convert-ly process before calling lilypond
- FIXED: two formats were missing for the custom export formats
- FIXED: a more logical sequence for the export formats

Also there is a piece of commented code where I tried to
remove the print export dialog page. This code leads to
a crash on my system unfortunately and I also browsed the
KDE sources (kprinter.cpp/h / kmuimanager.cpp/h) but did
not find out how to get rid of the dialog page.

Regards,

Reinhard

Hi,

Finally the release candidate one week later than planned due to the
german documentation updated has been released by me. As usual
report any problems with the release candidate to this list. The only
planned changes are updates to the translations as there were quite
some user interface updates during the beta period.
Have fun with the RC!
