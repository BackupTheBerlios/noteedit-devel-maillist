It looks a bit different for me but I haven't looked at the code
yet. See attached screenshot.

Hm... interesting. As far as I can tell, the Title is set to each 
buttonGroup correctly. And it is shown ok if the width of buttonGroups 
is enlarged. IMO, if the current width is used (maybe if I set a general 
KDE font to size 6, it works fine as well?), the title isn't cut-off, 
but hidden instead, as the whole title wouldn't get shown.

Message-ID: <429F3E9B.7070204@web.de>

Hi!

Since some time I think we are able to release rc1. But recently
some problems have appeared with the current beta:

- Key signature dialog layout problem with fonts
- configure problems on FreeBSD
- Stem positions are not saved (concerns f.e. staff properties)
- Many translations are missing
- documentation still not updated.

So if we want to fix these bug this would have to happen
very soon as I already wanted to have the release these
days. What do you think ?

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Hello,

Did you have a look at the patch I posted on 28th May? Configure works 
on FreeBSD with this patch, but you should check if

make -f Makefilecvs
./configure

still works on Linux - if it does, please apply the patch and commit 
(and let me know)

What parts of the docs are outdated?

I think the critical one is the stem positions for voices as it 
completely breaks the stem feature. I'm gonna fix it today if no one 
else is doing it. Other bugs can wait IMO.

About the translations, looks like most of the official translators I 
contacted are inactive at the moment. So I'm gonna send a deadline 
message today to all the translators that they must report a progress 
report immediately. But I'm also gonna start to seek the OS&KDE 
translators forums on the web and start posting requests for 
translation. I'd say a deadline for translations should be Sunday, 12. 
June 2005 at 23:59. Any translations sent later will not get included in 
the release. Is the sunday too late for us? The problem is that the 
non-familiar-with-NoteEdit translators would need some more time to do 
the quality translation. Maybe even 12th of June is too soon for them, 
but we need the translation till then...

Stem directions stuff is now fixed. I just added apply(); in the 
voiceBox destructor method. This way, when a dialog is closed or a 
switch to another staff is made, stem direction in voices get remembered 
as well.

Ok, then we can release the rc1 now with an announcement that we
seek translators. Do you already have put it in word so that I
could include it ?

No sunday is not too late. Also I'm ready to release a 2.8.1 only for
translation updates since it costs usually quite some time to do a
completely new translation. I will put in the announcement header that
we search for translators.

Yes, RC1 should be released ASAP. I already contacted translators again 
yesterday, but didn't recieve a single reply yet. I attached the two 
messages I sent so far (the first one a month ago, when b1 was 
released). I hope it helps anything. I also think we'll have to find 
some alternative translators tomorrow if I don't recieve any replies. Do 
you know of any translators or any other wider development forums and 
places. My idea was to go to KDE homepage and from there to as many 
forums and mailing lists as possible and send requests for the translation.

My thoughts the same. Version 2.8.1 should all in all include bugfixes 
only and a translation update is a very important fix for non-english 
speakers.
btw. When we're going to release 2.8 version, the plan is to split a svn 
tree to trunk-unstable (2.9.x) and stable (2.8.x), right? Also, homepage 
should be a separate tree IMO.

Yes I did, and it works on my system. As nobody else seems to have
problems with it until now, I have checked the patched configure.in.in
into svn. Thanks for the patch and best regards,

Hi,

that's great, thanks.

Attached is the next patch that removes the alloca.h includes (it is 
included in stdlib.h, also on Linux, but on Linux you have alloca.h 
separately as well). On FreeBSD, alloca.h is not available at all. 
(`man alloca` tells me to include stdlib.h)

Anyway, there should be no need to explicitely include alloca.h, 
attached patch comments out these includes. Can you please test with 
Linux and apply the patch if it works for you as well?

Thanks!!

Hi,

I uploaded rc1 to Berlios. For this release I created a makefile
that makes it more easy to create the release. I attached it
to the mail.
"make release" creates the archive from a freshly checked out
svn repository.
"make testrelease" unpacks the archive and creates the noteedit
binary. You still have to do a manual "make install" from the
noteedit directory as this requires root privileges.

I will upload another archive with the fresh patch from
raphael in about half an hour, so the officially announcement
is delayed until then.

Reinhard

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] 2.8.0 Release Candidate 1 released
Message-ID: <42A1B990.6000100@web.de>

This is the release candidate in the release cycle of the coming 2.8.0 
release of NoteEdit.
If you still find bugs post them in the Bug tracker. or mail them to the 
developer mailing list.
Known bugs can be found in the Bug tracker as well.

Since now, we were successfully maintaining the original English, German 
(most of NE developers), Slovenian (myself) and Slovakian (Zdenko 
Podobn?) translation. However, we did not recieve any progress report or 
confirmation about the translations to other languages.
Let me remind you that the deadline to commit the translation files is 
on Sunday, 12th June 2005, 23:59 CET.
Translations not being sent until Sunday will not make it to the stable 
2.8.0 version.

Please contact us immediately if you're making or going to make the 
translation work for your language. If we won't recieve a confirmation 
within 48 hours, we will assume that this message didn't reach
you and we'll start to search for another translators.

Release 2.8.0 RC1
--------------------
New features:
- Updated translations and fixed Makefile to include Slovenian translation.
- RFE #573 - Soprano clef added.
- Score info fields and staff names can now include double quotes ("), 
updated
export filters.
- RFE #730 - Direct MIDI import - one-click MIDI file import implemented.
- RFE #729 - warning message before TSE3 -> Score added.
- Automatic bar placement disabled if no time signature defined.
- Allow bar placement in empty staffs with no clef/key/time signature.
- Merged staff properties and voice dialog.
- Staff properties can now change all staffs at once, not only the 
current one.
- Menu point staff -> voices invokes the staff properties.
- More improvements to the menu: Easier access via keys, some better 
menu names
   (like Close / Quit, Select Multi Staff).
- Main window title now includes score title and subtitle by default, if 
none
   defined yet, it the current uses file name.
- Many score layout window improvements (bottom-up selection, resized 
buttons to
   fit captions on buttons, added form caption).
- Removed fuzzyness from german translation and updated all po(t) files
   (others will have fuzzyness as well until translated).
- Removed a thrilling MusiXTeX warning when exporting and replaced it with a
   nice notice dialog.
- New icon.
- Implemented splash screen.
- New playback shortcut. Changed Edit Mode and Insert Rest default 
shortcuts.
- Save main window position and size (default: available screen geometry).
- Toolbar settings of every toolbar are saved and restored.
- Integrated patch 403 - Better menu structure.
- Removed "Report Bug" menu item from help menu.
- The last selected key or time signature is now remembered and gets 
selected
   automatically when inserting it the second time.
- configure now works on FreeBSD (thanks to Raphael Langerhorst)

Bug fixes:
- Fixed #3944 - polyphony importing wrong in MusicXML.
- Fixed #3969 - Score layout: Text on buttons uncomplete.
- Fixed #3595 - dbl quotes in some score info fields leads to invalid files.

I think I should rather call  this a temporary fix, because 1) it's 
dependent on voiceBox and actual voices and 2) it doesn't support undo, 
neither the cancel button works for voices, but it doesn't work for 
deleting/creating voice too, so I'm not the only one:). In 2.9.x I think 
the staff properties dialog should be worked on even more to fix these 
issues.

What I like in staff properties is that the overspace, underspace is 
reflected in the score the same time you move the scroll. What do you 
think about the current state of staff properties, Reinhard, Georg? I'm 
gonna update wiki to write some ideas down about the staff properties.


btw. I've been thinking about submitting a Summer of code 
(http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html) project on NoteEdit. I'd like 
to implement a scripting language similar to Lisp for NoteEdit 
(command-line beside the mouse&keyboard interface, macro&plugin support) 
and a more advanced NoteEdit API (so the scripts written could do 
anything useful at all). Well, I probably won't even get among those 200 
lucky projects, but anyway:).

Agreed. I saw this weakness when I implemented the staff/voice 
properties but as it was already existant I didn't change it as
I don't know much about the NoteEdit internals. (Also undo/redo
improvement is already on our list).

Here I don't understand what you are trying to explain. Also I can't
say much about staff properties currently as I don't know all 
possibilities NoteEdit has or can have.

I'm against a lisp scripting language as it is for the normal user much
more complicated to learn than an object oriented programming language.
My favourite is ruby. Concerning Lilypond: If a user is able to make 
changes in his lilypond score that touch the lisp interface of lilypond
than he has completely different abilities than a normal NoteEdit user
has. Many of the possible NoteEdit users I know would ever dare to touch
a script written in a lisp language.

The first step for an advanced API is to actually document the API. The
base is of course the doxygen documentation and with that I would have
to find out where the interface between the script and NoteEdit has to
be drawn. The NoteEdit library is too big as an API for the scripting 
language itself (actually it contains complete NoteEdit, I ask myself
why the library is so big). What could be inside the API ?

- control of all typesetting elements
- control of staff / voices
- editing control
- file control
- Midi interface control
- import/export control

Things like transposition, change clef etc. should be done via scripts
or macros in the future. Also my idea is to provide many default macros 
to the user as a base for composition work and for own scripts/macros.

There probably is no real difference between macros and scripts. I would
call a macro a short script which can be recorded and played back within
noteedit. This would be another way to create a basic script that can
later be expanded with your favourite text editor :).

Currently I can't really imagine why NoteEdit requires a real plugin
support. I think scripting / macros support is enough. It still probably
will be painful enough to expand NoteEdit so that a scripting interface
can be created.

As the LAD is no mentoring organization it will get really difficult
for us. Also NoteEdit is not yet part of a foundry.

Personally I don't know the lisp language. I'm only aware of it through 
LilyPond, so that's why I first took a look on lisp. I'll take a look at 
ruby this evening. Also, what about python or perl languages? Or lua? 
What I have are some short ideas of why the scripts could be used for. 
I'm still searching the net for the right language as we're not going to 
write our own one, right?

Some features that just came to my mind that NoteEdit should also 
provide are actions like Selecting the certain chord (which selects all 
the notes in all voices and staffs which are held simultaniously at that 
moment), calculating intervals (the quality (major, minor, perfect, 
diminished, augmented) and quantity (prime, second, third, fourth, fifth 
etc.)) and so on. I think the scripts should have a useful framework so 
they could actually be made useful (for harmonization or whatever already).

I agree, these things and probably many others in the future should be 
performed by NoteEdit's system scripts (the same as different engravers 
are made in LilyPond, only the core and cpu most demanding stuff is in 
C++) and not the NoteEdit itself.

Yes, a very important feature of a scripting language should be 
inclusion of other scripts. So NoteEdit should offer some basic scripts 
(or macros). You should then only include them and make a more complex 
scenario based on the included scripts.

That's correct. I didn't have a real idea of differnce bw/ plugin, 
script and macro. If plugins are treated as precompiled modules attached 
to the main app, then no, we don't need plugins. Scripts should satisfy. 
They can also fit nicely into NoteEdit UI (they should be a part of the 
menu and the user wouldn't even know what's behind the UI, a script 
should be ran in a separate thread and a user could stop it, a script 
could report the current progress so the status bar in NoteEdit will get 
updated and so on).

Dear translation teams!

We're happy to announce that a new version of NoteEdit - a Qt/KDE music 
score editor, is going to be released in a few weeks. We're even happier 
as this is our first major release developed by the new development 
team, since the original author and maintainer for a long time J?rg 
Anders left the project. A new 2.8.0 version brings many new features 
and even more bug squashes. You can read more about them on the project 
website.

The important thing is that a new release brought many menu 
reorganizations, new warnings and messages, different signs and labels 
and so on. The old 2.7.3 version of NoteEdit already included a 
translation for languages de, es, fr, hu, it, ru, sk and sv. We managed 
to keep updated the original English, German (most of developers), a new 
Slovenian (myself) and Slovakian (Zdenko Podobny) translation. We 
contacted the original translators, but for the exception of Zdenko, 
didn't recieved any replies. So, we'd like you to visit our website 
(http://noteedit.berlios.de), download the latest Release Candidate 
version (or the SVN version) of NoteEdit and send us the updated 
translation file for your language. A deadline for the translations that 
will make it to 2.8.0 is Sunday, 12th June 2005, 23:59. Translations 
sent later will not make it to the 2.8.0 version, but will be included 
in the next one, which will probably be released within a month.

Please let us know if you recieved this message and if anyone of you is 
prepared to do a translation for his/her language. If no replies are 
recieved, we'll assume that this message didn't make it to the mailing 
list and we'll start searching for other translators and try to contact 
other translator centers.


Best wishes & good luck!

Hi Matev?,

I would like to report that the stem direction gets only remembered when
you open the voice dialog at least two times. It's reproducable:

    -- start new File
    -- create two voices, voice one stems up, voice two stems down
    -- add clef
    -- add time signature
    -- select 1st voice
    -- insert notes                    stems are up or down: not working,

but with this one:

    -- start new File
    -- create two voices, voice one stems up, voice two stems down
    -- add clef
    -- add time signature
    -- open voice dialog again, close it with ok
    -- select 1st voice
    -- insert notes                    stems are up: working.

I guess I'll not have time to dig in it, next week I'm on travel, but
would check stemPolicy_ being set (?).

Best Regards,
Georg

Ok, I have found a python <-> ruby comparison on the ruby page (FAQ):
http://www.rubygarden.org/faq/entry/show/14

And a comparison chart:
http://www.approximity.com/ruby/Comparison_rb_st_m_java.html

I cannot recommand perl as it's syntax tends programmers to make
unreadable code. It's of course very powerful and has a lot of
add-on modules (CPan) but it's no pure object-oriented language like 
ruby (python has also procedural elements like Perl). I don't know
LUA but from it's description it's also a procedural language. The
main difference between Python and Ruby seems to be the complexity.
You can also download a ruby book:

The basic question is if we want to have every element of Noteedit
as an object or not. I vote for yes as it is the more natural way
of programming. It also should make the transition from C++ NoteEdit
code to scripting code more easily.

Selection of whatever (notes, chords, systems, voices, ...) if of course
part of editing control. The rest would probably be simple methods on
one note (concerning interval calculating). Maybe it would help to sort
the API also on objects (note, staffs, voices, files, rests, ...)

All of the above languages support such an include feature.

features (authors need to be added) and then update the current site?

Yes, the patch doesn't work as expected. I made a new cleaner patch 
(which should work?), but I'm waiting for SVN to get working (it's 
currently having some problems...). I'll commit ASAP. Please test then.

What about trying with --noalsa or --nooss parameters. This way, no
sound playback will be available, but you could still use NoteEdit.

Like I said, here is my update :)

Probably you might like recompressing the graphics.

In all *.html files just replace <font ... >NoteEdit</font> with <img
src="img/logo.png" alt="logo"> in the first <div</div>

Is SVN working for you guys? I was trying to checkout the latest version 
and commit my voice stem direction fixes these days and I didn't manage 
to get any response from the SVN Berlios server. Or is it just my firewall?

Hi,

for me it's also not working since yesterday. It worked 'till now all

Strange.

Great! I tried to check in after some updates to the
new homepage but failed, svn seems not to be working...
I haven't checked Berlios, but this is since more than 1 day now.

So far I only found out that the last access to the repository
seemed to have been: 2005-06-06 13:24

At that time I was probably eating in the firm I work where I don't do
any NoteEdit development.

svnadmin recover /svnroot/repos/noteedit

gives the following error message:
svn: Failed to get exclusive repository access; perhaps another process
such as httpd, svnserve or svn has it open?

I haven't found out anything other (lock files or similar) blocking
the db access. Web Access (i.e. read) access is also impossible at
the moment. Any further ideas ?

Regards,

Reinhard

I tried with --noalsa then --nooss. All three
combinatations gave me the same results as below.

Qt: 3.3.4
KDE: 3.4.1
NoteEdit: 2.8.0-rc1	

What else could it be. Is it because I am in 64bit mode or do I need
tse3 0.2.5 insteas of 0.2.7?

Hmm, maybe you could try it the other way around? I'm also on amd64, and
things are working nicely. Maybe your sound is not working at all? Maybe
you should first get timidity running in server mode, connect it, with
kaconnect or something else, with vkeybd and play some sounds? Then
start NoteEdit. (I also have KDE's artsd shut down, and run timidity on
jack.)

Report what's going on,
Regards,
Georg.

So I launched jack then I launched timidity with the following options:

timidity  -iA -Oj

This launched timidity with jack output and as an alsa sequencer client.
Then I did aconnect 64:0 128:0 and hit a few keys on my keyboard. I had sound.

Noteedit crashed again with the same errors. I decided to run it in gdb
and do a backtrace on it. 

The binary does not have debugging support enabled. I can recompile it
with debugging into the binary if you think it will help.

Here it is:

I guess maybe the problem is with tse3 or somethings.

Hmm, further debugging could be helpful, but now I'm offline 'till next
week, so only as a short comment: I'm on Suse 9.3, and their rpm might
give insight if  any patch/build option is needed ...

That's all for the moment from me,

Maybe, here is what NoteEdit actually does:

NMidiMapper::NMidiMapper() : QObject() {
         theScheduler_ = 0;
         echoChannel_ = 0;
         theScheduler_ = 0;
         channelPool_ = 0x0;
         lastSelectedChannel_ = 0;
#ifdef TSE3_HAS_ARTS
         if (NResource::schedulerRequest_ & ARTS_SCHEDULER_REQUESTED) {
                 try {
 
TSE3::Plt::UnixMidiSchedulerFactory::setPreferredPlatform(TSE3::Plt::UnixMidiSchedulerFactory::UnixPlatform_Arts);
                         theScheduler_ = theFactory_.createScheduler();
                         cout << "TSE3 aRts MIDI scheduler created" << endl;
                 }
                 catch (TSE3::MidiSchedulerError e) {
                         cerr << "cannot create an aRts MIDI Scheduler" 
<< endl;
                 }
         }
#endif

The other problem might be arts if you have compiled with arts.
Else another midi scheduler gets created:

 
TSE3::Plt::UnixMidiSchedulerFactory::setPreferredPlatform(TSE3::Plt::UnixMidiSchedulerFactory::UnixPlatform_Alsa);
                         theScheduler_ = theFactory_.createScheduler();


I don't know anything about this stuff except those things from the FAQ.
The only thing I can tell you to check your midi kernel modules or try
to compile/start without midi support. Maybe the tse3 test program can
help trying to find out what's going wrong.

I have the following midi modules loaded:
$ lsmod | grep midi

snd-seq-midi            6688  0
snd-seq-virmidi         5952  0
snd-rawmidi            20768  3 snd-usb-lib,snd-seq-midi,snd-seq-virmidi
snd-seq-midi-event      6592  3 snd-seq-oss,snd-seq-midi,snd-seq-virmidi
snd-seq                49552  9 
snd-seq-dummy,snd-seq-oss,snd-seq-midi-emul,snd-seq-midi,snd-seq-instr,snd-seq-virmidi,snd-seq-midi-event
snd-seq-device          6860  5 
snd-seq-dummy,snd-seq-oss,snd-seq-midi,snd-rawmidi,snd-seq

modprobe.preload contrains the following midi modules:
snd-seq

I have posted a bug report at berlios. There is at least one other 
project having access problems though not described in detail.

On svn.berlios.de I found out that the db directory is still accessed
by whiteangel, itsgeorg and suamor (svnserve processes). Maybe there
is a way to kill all these processes. I haven't studied the svn manual
in this regard.

Hi,

Whatever the berlios folks did, SVN is now working again.
I just checked in the new homepage with several modifications
of me. I'm still not finished with it, but some other can
do this as well as I won't have time to do it until sunday.

Cool, I finally commited the working 
remember-stem-direction-in-voice-dialog patch. Please test.

Meanwhile, I'm trying to dig out the ritardando/accellerando MIDI 
playback bug. It was present from every version of NE I remember. It 
goes like this:
When eg. Ritardando sign is present, the notes after the sign sometimes 
get accellerated (instead of slowed down), sometimes even to a few 
miliseconds (so all you hear is a loud bang when MIDI playback comes to 
rit.). However, it's not quite repeatable. In the following example, you 
can try to playback from note to note before the rit. sign and you 
should be able to spot the bug. From what I found out, I can tell that 
if you playback the second time from the same note, the rit. always gets 
played correctly. And if you try to playback from the last note before 
rit. it's always repeatable. And if you move from note to note randomly, 
it sometimes work and sometimes doesn't. I don't know... are your 
findings the same?

I'm not sure if I'll be able to fix this bug till 2.8.0. Maybe it should 
be critical along with some similar trill. bugs (if accidental is 
placed, pitches not always played correctly) and maybe a negative time 
for grace notes solution, I spotted, for 2.8.1?

This really sounds great! I didn't expect anything as I didn't get any
feedback the last days on translation.

I hope that we get the french translation, but I don't think we
get feedback for that until wendsday when Georg has returned. Also
there is still the crash bug I couldn't reproduce until now but I
haven't looked closer the last 4 days.

Message-ID: <20050616213418.GA13343@localhost>

Hi all,

Please find attached corrections from Jens Seidel for the German
translation of 2.7.4, along with english typos fixes. This patch was
sent to the Debian Bug Tracking System (see also [1] and [2])
http://bugs.debian.org/313942 and http://bugs.debian.org/noteedit)

Unfortunately I haven't had the time to test 2.8.0-rc1 yet, but I have
prepared a debian package for 2.7.4. The current version can be found at
http://piem.org/debian/noteedit/ . You will find all the modifications
made in the .diff.gz file. Comments and feedback welcome.

I noted the following issues in version 2.7.4:

 - i did get to reproduce #230891 after loading a large
   multichannel midifile [1].

 - the kprinter box is broken, only pdf works. it seems to fail finding
   tools in /usr/bin. the error is: "Cannot save print file to
   /home/piem/print.ps. Check that you have write access to it."

 - tse3play does not seem to be willing to play at all (most likely a
   tse3play bug).

 - autobar, on some files [2], eats all the cpu and never returns

 - autobeam sometimes crashes on createUndo

 - quite a few warnings when compiling (debian unstable / powerpc)
   examples include:

mainframewidget.cpp:674: warning: `connectItem' is deprecated (declared at 
   /usr/include/kde/kaccel.h:337)
mainframewidget.cpp:675: warning: `insertItem' is deprecated (declared at 
   /usr/include/kde/kaccel.h:329)

...

tse3handler.cpp:220: warning: comparison is always true due to limited range of 
   data type
tse3handler.cpp:223: warning: passing `double' for converting 1 of `
   TSE3::Clock::Clock(int)'

 - temporary files locations are a bit weird (should use kde temp dir
   instead) 


Cheers, Paul

OK.

I noticed that nearly all problems I reported vanished in 2.7.4, very
good. Nevertheless I found many minor issues during a complete
proofread.

Since the text was written in new German orthography I ensured that it is
consistently used.

I also found a few issues with English texts:

#: voicedialog.cpp:114
msgid ""
"The direction of the stems of the notes in voice number %1 will be chosen "
s/chosen/choosen/

#: configuredialog.cpp:135
msgid ""
"The last score that was open the last time the appliaction was used will be "
s/appliaction/application/

#: uiconnect.cpp:222
msgid ""
"Actually LilyPond is not supported by your system. Do you realy want to make "
s/realy/really/

#: lilyexport.cpp:529
msgid "Staff %1, measure %2: 128th in mesaure; minimum is 64th\n"
It should be "measure" not "mesaure", right?

#: filehandler.cpp:549
msgid "Staff %1 ; measure %2 :The multirests are not aligned\n"
spaces!!!

#: musixtex.cpp:656
msgid "too many beams in measure: %1; maximum: %2\n"
s/too/Too/

Please do not forget to send it upstream,
Jens

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Flyer for the Linuxtag 2005
Message-ID: <42B58281.80604@web.de>

Hi,

I created a first version for a LinuxTag 2005 flyer (see attachment for
files). It is based on the Logo from the splash screen and the icon
both converted to BW with gimp. (If you don't have the svg's any
longer and need them just drop me a note).

Most of the text is from the README and doesn't need to be changed.
I added a "Help Us" section and expanded Homepage & Mailing list under
a "Get in Contact" headline. If you have better ideas to improve
this just go ahead and mail it (or change the document directly).

I've also added some information how to get noteedit source and
binaries as well as some hints what is in the noteedit archive.

I'm also restarting work on the poster after I get back from a
bicycle ride (in one or two hours).

Linuxtag 2005 preparation is costing much time so there was no
time left for me doing something on NoteEdit. The release is
still pending and I wouldn't disagree if someone could bring
it out even if the crash bug at start still isn't fixed (I
didn't have the time to look for that as well).

Georg: I've sent you the administration passwords when I
created the mailing lists. If you don't have them any
more just tell me.

Best Regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Hello to all!

As we haven't heard in a while, I'd like to bring some update. I tackled 
with some minor bugs in NoteEdit this week (like "nothing to play" -> 
"Nothing to play!" and "d flat major; b minor" -> "d flat major; b flat 
minor" typos and appropriately updating translations). However, I've 
been quite busy with the exams and I don't doubt you were busy too. 
Also, how's with LinuxTag?

About development, I think it's high time to release the 2.8.0 and make 
a 2.9.x branch. I have some harder bugs to fix and some brainstorm ideas 
and would need the 2.9.x being available asap. Meanwhile, I updated our 
wiki brainstorm ideas a bit. Please let me know what do you think about 
the new Dynamic tempo idea. Soon, the exams will end and I might be able 
to get myself coding! Ideas like implementation of Ruby scripting 
language, a new API, new keyboard shortcuts and UI, tons of new features 
introduced on Wiki are waiting in my head to get out:). Ugh, I also hope 
I don't lose my anxiousness when I start the real coding:).


Best summer regards!

Hi Matev?,

I'm on IRC now, too and meanwhile playing viola a bit for the
summer concerts (Haendel Messias).

I wrote about on an extra Mail. For recapitulation: I will be on the
LinuxTag from Di (afternoon, we're building the Audio booth there
and in the evening we have some lunch) to Saturday afternoon (in
the evening I will have my serenace concert). Meanwhile I was busy
preparing (mainly cleaning up and backuping my laptop, still not
finished with that work.).

I wish you all the best with your exams!

Yes, the release can be done anytime soon. I just have priority on
flyer and poster so basically some needs to checkout SVN run my build
scripts on them. Before doing that in all files 2.8.0-rc1 has to be
replaced by 2.8.0.

> and would need the 2.9.x being available asap. Meanwhile, I updated our 

2.9.x leading to 3.0.x will be in a new branch. It's not really
difficult to do that according to the docs but still I haven't managed
it to do that up to now.

Well I'd be happy if I'd finally finished reading the docs but that's
probably needs some more days as well (probably continue on wednesday).
After that I wanted to start a real comparison between QT 4 and the
current gtkmm (including gconfmm as gtkmm has now configuration support 
AFAIK). Concerning coding I mainly will work on 2.8 first as the 
printing dialog will be hopefully in one of the next releases also.

Reinhard

Hi!

As you probably already noted the 2.8.0 release is still pending.
As we just got some improvements to the german translation and
I don't have the time for a release today and tomorrow I will
do it on tuesday. That leaves some time for last-minute tests
as well. I there is any reason not to release 2.8.0 please tell
it very soon because for the Linuxtag me, Georg and Matevz would
really like to have the release out.

I hope to have some time left on the Linuxtag to start the
2.9.x branch. After that everything is open again :)

Message-ID: <42B70BAE.10600@web.de>

Hi,

I have created a Flyer and a T-Shirt for NoteEdit / LAD / Linuxtag.
If you want to print your own one (there are dozens of shops printing
T-Shirts from PDF-Files) you have to change the Name on the back
of the T-Shirt. Alternatively you could change some of the Logos
(replacing them f.e. with the NoteEdit-Logo). Also everything
is black-white. (for dark-color-shirts you probably would have
to change the file as well).

The flyer is in available in english and german while the t-shirt
is only german (just kidding ;-). I did not include postscript or
pdf files but I recommand to print to postscript with OpenOffice
first as the pdf version of my OOWriter inverses the NoteEdit Logo.
To create a PDF you could use ps2pdf.

Best regards,

applications. However, are there any real alternatives at all we could 
consider (free, portable, mature&working&useful as tse3)? I read about 
PortMidi, but it's a long way from being a usable sequencer lib (not 
only a driver for sending midi commands to midi port). Do Qt/gtkmm have 
any midi libraries included?

I searched the web for occurences of NoteEdit and found many sites 
pointing to the old Joerg's place. I went through all the first page of 
Google's hits and contacted their site administrators to correct the 
links to the new home. I also spotted TSE3 home being not up to date and 
contacted Pete. I think people shouldn't have the feeling that this 
project is dieing out by looking at the old NE's home. Sometimes I feel 
like people don't take this project seriously enough.

Second, I removed the QtCheckBox warning every time NoteEdit is ran, by 
deleting the value Checked with string "true" from mupWarning.ui. I'm 
not sure why this was good in the first place, because checked is 
already a binary value with bool true/false. If anyone knows, please 
correct it back.

Third, I removed the Lily warnings (like \property not found, WITHOUT 
slures, WITH semicolons etc.) from lilytest.cpp. I think they are not 
needed anymore now, because Lily export is tested enough and works fine 
and I also think they are obsolete (some ranging to <2.0 versions of 
lily) and shouldn't be mentioned anymore as convert-ly should convert 
the whatever-version-already-exported to the latest version of Lilypond 
syntax. The only warning I left was the Lilypond version found output 
(returns x.y.z or not found).

Fourth, I added my Ballade no.1 and Fugue no.1 I composed some time ago 
to NoteEdit examples. Anyone knows if the examples are installed to 
/usr/share/noteedit as well? Because currently, looking at /usr/local 
I'm not able to find them anywhere. They're only present in NoteEdit 
source dir.


Best regards!

Thanks, great stuff. I like your music especially. Had to tune the
volumes a little bit. I like to have this other style and contemporary
stuff in the examples.

Hopefully will soon have more time,

Hello Philippe,

Thanks for the hint. We had one bug report reporting a
crash on startup. This person had a problem with the midi
scheduler, I suppose a problem with the tse3 library according
to the backtrace he sent me.

I don't have this problem and never had a similar one. I just
suppose that it is either midi modules from the kernel missing
(try to load snd--seq-virmidi or snd-seq-dummy (the last one
creates a Midi Through device).

Also there was a new tse3 library released end of may so you
might want to check that one as well as some patches included
with the Mandrake tse3 library (included as attachment).
(use patch -p1 < patchname to apply one patch in the noteedit
build directory)

You should be able to find more about the bug by building
noteedit with the --enable-debug option which includes symbols
in the noteedit binary so it is easier to find out why and
where it crashed. If you start noteedit within the build
directory (after make install) like this:

$ gdb noteedit/.libs/noteedit

and start it with "run" you get back at the gdb prompt as
soon as it crashed. doing a "bt" (backtrace) afterwards
shows the line where it crashed.

You can read on the noteedit project page bug #4235 and support
request #101375 for more information. It would be nice to know
if it is the same bug and if the above methods fix the problem.

first.

At least the applications on the tse3 page seem to have no development 
anymore since more than 2 years (except noteedit).

No they don't. I know of MidiShare being still developed and being 
portable, also I read that berlios contains a simple midi library
(Click on the main project page in the description on the "Midi"-Topic
to see the midi application containing simili.

I also read on freshmeat.net about libjdkmidi (quite old, last change
in spring of last year), libkmid (well known to us), Also saw some
on http://www.linux-sound.org/ but didn't look at it yet. MidiShare
still is my favourite.

Hi Reinhard & others!

Could you please (if you have it) upload the on-line documentation (as
seen on the old website) to let's say htdocs/doc folder and make a
link to it under the Documentation section on the webpage. When I sent
requests for the NoteEdit new home to the first Google hits I got
describing NoteEdit , I got replies from many webmasters that they had
a link to the documentation of NoteEdit on their site as well, but
they cannot find any on the new site anymore.

Is it just me... or is our SVN server down again? I can login, but I'm
unable to update/commit anything.

Ok, it works now fine. Probably a maintainence or a bad luck:). Sorry
for the dust.

Ok, I put the online documentation online again :-).
I also put up the new homepage as all of you probably already noted :).
Also for those knowing the "new" homepage already: I added a help page.

There is still some work to do:
- Properly integrate the FAQ
- More screenshots from you.
- Make a script modyfing the generated html pages from meinproc in a
   way that it fits to the homepage design.

I leave this work as an exercise to the reader :-)

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Another thing: Did you try out the patches for tse3 I sent to the
mailing list as well as the latest tse3 ? I'd really like to know
if they fix this problem as it doesn't happen on several systems
I tested.
