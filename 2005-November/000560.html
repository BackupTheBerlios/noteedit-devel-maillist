<PRE>|<i> I'm not sure what do you have in mind by 'moving notes horizontally'. Do
</I>|<i> you mean voices? If so, go to Format-&gt;Staff properties-&gt;Voices and
</I>|<i> create a new voice. You can cycle through voices by left/right clicking

Sorry for being to confusing. The problem I'm referring to is the following: 
Imagine a line with two voices. Voice 1 has to play 1/2 note, let's say g'. 
Voice 2 begins at the same time with 1/8 g' (of course there are a number of 
notes following during the 1/2 note of voice 1, but this doesn't matter). 
Noteedit sets both g' together, the one of voice 2 with a stem down (and a 
flag), the one of voice 1 with a stem up. Because one of the notes is an 
eigtht (could be a quarter too), the head of the note is filled.
The problem: you can't see, that voice 1 plays an half note, it looks like a 
quarter note (you have to count the notes to find it out). The usual solution 
is to move the half note one width of a note to the left or the right, so 
both g' are lying side by side.

|<i> Hm... what do you mean by break? NoteEdit writes the whole score into
</I>|<i> single line, without page or line breaks. If you mean rests, you can
</I>|<i> simply place them in individual voices independently one to another.
</I>
Yes, I meant rest (sorry for my english). The problem is, that you can move 
ALL notes of one voice up or down. But sometimes a voice containes notes in 
an area, where the rest of the other voice would be placed usually. Then you 
have to lower or raise the rest to avoid it be placed over the notes.

Greetings
Michael
