I have no copy. But perhaps I can find the page in our backup
system.

It is my serious opinion NoteEdit should die if it is so
consequently ignored by the LAU list (see below).

I'll search in backup system. But don't misunderstand me:
I placed a link to the berlios page at the old noteedit URL.
But do not expect too much help from me. If I find the pages
I'll send them to you. If you don't hear from me till monday,
you should assume I haven't found it.

I append the discontinuation FAQ, which contains still more
aspects and at the end a statement which could eventually
influence your development.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Discontinuation FAQ
===================


Q: I read about the &quot;unclear statements&quot;. How did those LAU
    posts lead to stopping development?

A: Note! The mails are form LAU list. The leading list for
    opinions concerning audio on Linux which has great influence on
    all Linux users and distributers.

    I do not really believe, there will be a Finale port on Linux.
    But there is a small probability especially if so many LAU members
    have the fondest wish to overcome tools like NoteEdit as that LAU
    thread suggests and if they send appropriate requests to Codamusic.
    And that would certainly stop NoteEdit usage.

  ----------------------------------------------------------

Q: But Finale will never be free!

A: Please remember the history of StarOffice, the predecessor of
    OpenOffice. Despite of the situation on MS-Windows, the Linux
    version was always free of charge. Because Finale-NotePad is free
    on MS-Windows, too, there is certain probability for a free
    variant of Finale(-NotePad) on Linux.

  -----------------------------------------------------------

Q: I don't read that thread like you do. In all, perhaps three
    people were seriously interested in Finale for Linux!

A: Ok, this is an aspect. But you cannot disavow the LAU list
    consequently ignores NoteEdit. Read a very typical thread starting
    here:

       <A HREF="http://eca.cx/lau/2004/01/0119.html">http://eca.cx/lau/2004/01/0119.html</A>

    A user asks for &quot;music editing software&quot;. In my ears it sounds
    like &quot;NoteEdit&quot;. But trace the thread of 28 mails! NoteEdit is
    neither mentioned nor recommended. But I thought somebody would at
    least mention the word &quot;NoteEdit&quot;. Ok, I could post the word. But,
    if I, the author, am the one and only person who has this
    association, why continue NoteEdit?

    And do not answer this is a bad example! If you wish I can search
    for more threads.

    And it has practical consequences. NoteEdit was never part of the
    official Red Hat or Fedora distribution. And it is quite clear
    why: I assume the Fedora packers are not musicians. So they cannot
    estimate the different musical score software packages. Indeed,
    SuSE was the one and only distributer who packed NoteEdit in a
    very early stage. And again I can tell you why: The person
    responsible for the SuSE sound packages is a musician. He does not
    depend on the LAU opinion. And he posted the one and only clear
    NoteEdit statement:

       <A HREF="http://eca.cx/lau/2002/07/0455.html">http://eca.cx/lau/2002/07/0455.html</A>

    Another consequence: I presented NoteEdit at some exhibitions.
    The audience was always enthusiastic and exciting. But, nobody knew
    NoteEdit: &quot;Ok, but this is a commercial product, because Linux
    has only Rosegarden.&quot;, was the first impression.
    &quot;No&quot;, I answered, &quot;it is even part of the SuSE Linux
    distribution!&quot;. Big surprise! I had the greatest difficulties to
    explain it is GPL. It was necessary to prepare a plate stating:
    &quot;This software is GPL.&quot;

  ----------------------------------------------

Q: Do you really refuse any support ?

A: Assume the following situation:

       - SuSE wants to release SuSE-Linux 12 (or so )
       - KDE4 is the current KDE version
       - NoteEdit is un-compilable on KDE4
       - the LilyPond changes syntax such, that the NoteEdit LilyPond
         output is wrong
       - The SuSE packers phone me and ask for a KDE4/LilyPond-x.y.z
         compatible NoteEdit

    Because it is relatively easy for me I'd release the appropiate
    NoteEdit version. I'd honor the fact that SuSE places emphasis on
    NoteEdit in a very early stage.
