<PRE>Hi,

Noteedit is a great tool for note editing. I'm using it since years
and have experienced many improvements in the course of the
development. I had occasional contact with the creator of noteedit,
Joerg Anders and had the pleasure to meet him himself at the
Linuxtag 2003 in Karlsruhe. I'm regretting that Joerg Anders has
decided to quit the development of noteedit.

I'm planning to become one of the project leaders for noteedit. I have
made some plans for the project management and have several ideas
how to continue development:

- create project page on developer.berlios.de    - Done
- create two mailing lists: Developer and User   - Done for Developer
- create bugtracking system                      - Done
- create patch system (integrate with bugtracking ?)
   (including version to be patched)              - Done (separately)
- upload current version                         - Done
- create and configure subversion
- import source files into subversion directory
- contact authors of noteedit about these plans  - Done by this mail
- develop overview of source code
- subversion daily changes ?
- changelog of old versions ?
- todo list
- development environment: kdevelop
- developer documentation for noteedit
- Improve FAQs and HOWTOs further

Aside from the main development I also plan to compare noteedit with
similar programs available for Linux like rosegarden, denemo (a
frontend for lilypond). I think it is important for noteedit to
be able to exchange data with these programs not only using midi
but also formats like musixml.

I want to make it easier for users to print from noteedit. Currently
you have to export to a format like lilypond or pmx and must call
the program manually before you are able to print the result to the
printer. I think it is better to do it similar to lyx: You have
several print options (lilypond as default) and preview options like
dvi, ps, pdf. Also it could be useful to have mup (the noteedit
interpreter for the noteedit format) as external program to automate
&quot;building&quot; of pdf or ps files to print them.

Everyone being interested in the continued development of noteedit
should not hesitate to comment on this mail or to contact me directly.
The goals should be to improve the ease of use of the program while
keeping the spirit of the current version intact (i.e. no redesign
of the user interface or similar). This way it noteedit will continue
to be the most useful free musicial notation program for Linux.

The project page is <A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/noteedit">http://developer.berlios.de/projects/noteedit</A>
To join the project you currently have to mail me your berlios
account login so I can add you to the lists of developers.

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

P.S.
If this mail arrived twice it is because I could not reach the
mail address of Matt Gerassimoff.
