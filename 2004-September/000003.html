<PRE>Hello Vit,

Actually I have a small todo list but these are more administrative
task for a project manager and for developer who wish to start coding
on noteedit. I want to use the berlios &quot;feature request&quot; manager
( <A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/feature/?group_id=2232">http://developer.berlios.de/feature/?group_id=2232</A> ) to manage the
todo list. We can always put the current status of it on the &quot;TODO&quot;
file which is in SVN.

&gt;<i> We'd like to have NoteEdit capable of:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> wxWidgets (portability to Windows) / QT (compile-time option)
</I>&gt;<i> OSS/SDL MIDI support
</I>
I don't think this is necessary as there already is a QT port for
Cygwin available as well as kde (kdiff3 f.e. is a kde application
ported to native windows, i.e. doesn't need X11).

I agree that MIDI improvement could be done. I don't know enough
about TSE3 to decide if it is platform independent. SDL seems to
be the better option here. OTOH tse3 play features would have to
be ported to SDL.

&gt;<i> Mostly we'd be happy to use NoteEdit on both platforms and without being
</I>&gt;<i> forced to use KDE (but with KDE as an option).
</I>
Currently I can't tell you how deep KDE and QT are integrated into
noteedit. The user interface itself is only one aspect. QT offers
itself many additional features (Strings, Dynamic Arrays, Pointer Lists
etc.) which might make it much more complicated to port it to wxWidgets
or GTK.

&gt;<i> If You think it's compatible with Your roadmap (at least in parallel
</I>&gt;<i> branch), we'd like to join your team (3 coders, linux, cygwin platform).
</I>
Of course that it is! My main roadmap currently is to fix bugs and make
some smaller improvements to printing. Everything else will require a
deeper dive for me into noteedit internals.

Best regards,
