<PRE>Hi Matev&#382;,

&gt;<i> Hi Csaba and others!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sunday is ok with me. Although I have a few questions/issues I should
</I>&gt;<i> ask about your opinion:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) What do you think about status_type type? Is it implemented ok? I
</I>&gt;<i> ask, because I don't know what's the common practice when coming to this
</I>&gt;<i> kind of problems. ie. We needed 64bit integer for the most commonly used
</I>&gt;<i> status flags, so 1) &quot;unsigned long long&quot; was IMO too long to write in
</I>&gt;<i> the code every time and 2) the 64bit integer isn't uniquely declared in
</I>&gt;<i> all OSes/compilers (M$VC has __uint64 for this type I think). So I came
</I>&gt;<i> up with #define status_type idea. Is it ok? Or is there another better way?
</I>
Hmm, still thinking about the Chord &quot;states&quot;. We have these many &quot;stats&quot;
(I wouldn't call them states but something like property). First I find
the current solution quite horrible to read and to understand. But I 
have no quick solution for the state &quot;problem&quot;. 64bit types are not 
really portable, the only one I know is &quot;long long&quot; (see how Qt defines
64bit types). On the other hand I don't know really how deep these
&quot;states&quot; are part of NoteEdit. I would even prefer a state structure
to the current way states are handled, something like

typedef struct NMusStatus
{
   int state_categ1,
   int state_categ2
} NMusStatus_T;

and later we could try to find a better solution for these states
while still keeping the set/get methods with this structure.

&gt;<i> 2) The reason why status2 existed from the first place was IMO the upper
</I>&gt;<i> limit of 32 bits for status. Pedal markings would exceed that limit, so
</I>&gt;<i> a new status2 was introduced. Now that this limit was expanded to
</I>&gt;<i> 64bits, these two could be simply merged. My question is, what will we
</I>&gt;<i> do, if we exceed 64bits for status type - what else will or won't we
</I>&gt;<i> store in status? IMO, we should store musElement properties which are
</I>&gt;<i> present in status, to separate variables as well. I would propose a
</I>&gt;<i> rule, that status should only include the most commonly used - where
</I>&gt;<i> speed/bitwise operations are critical. All other properties should only
</I>&gt;<i> be stored in separate variable.
</I>
After reading your statement I think a structure for storing this
information is the best solution for the problem. So if NoteEdit has
a need (like time-critical operations) for bitwise operations on states
we could keep them as states like now and all other properties could
be stored in another way.

&gt;<i> 3) Current status's flags positions in status are important. I tried to
</I>&gt;<i> sort out most of the problems, when I migrated from 32bit to 64bit
</I>&gt;<i> integer by using status_type instead of int, but I left some. eg. All
</I>&gt;<i> the dotted/ddotted note methods still use status_type &lt;-&gt; plain integer
</I>&gt;<i> or even char casting, as the dotted note flag is one of the first bits
</I>&gt;<i> of the status, so the methods preserve some memory. I think we should
</I>&gt;<i> force all the methods that do anything with status in any case, to use
</I>&gt;<i> status_type in the future though (eg. int != uint troubles). However,
</I>&gt;<i> what I don't know is again the common practice in this case - is it the
</I>&gt;<i> right thing to do (speed/memory consuption/administration).
</I>
On time critical operations I would tend to be able to change state
operations directly but not on the global state but only local. When
the time critical operation is over the state can be globally updated
with one of the get/set methods. This way we gain more data 
encapsulation while still keeping performance at a high level.
Encapsulation is also important if we ever want to make NoteEdit more
modular.

Rule 20 of Effective C++ says: Avoid data members in the practice.
Also very important for our design: Rule 34: Minimize compilation
dependencies between files. Even better would be if we would be able
avoid having all the same state handling throughout NoteEdit. That
would mean if anyone make a larger change on the State structure
we would have to change a large portion of the NoteEdit code again.

Reinhard
