Message-ID: <1191572595.5882.19.camel@tomas>

First of all, I'm sorry if this is the no correct place to ask about
TSE3 library.

In the university of Alicante are working to build an interface of midi
songs, with play, stop and pause buttons.

The play and stop functions are clear, but the problems is the pause
function.

TSE3 don't have a pause method in the transport object, so I'm trying to
develop the pause function doing transport.stop() and save the last
clock of the MidiScheduler class, after than I do play() with the last
clock saved.

The problem is that the song loose the tempo and the musical
instruments, it assume the piano as melody instument, and 120 pulses of
tempo. It seems that the song begin at middle and don't read the tempo
and instrument.

They is some way of inject the instrument and tempo in a song?


I have very been thankful if you can help me. 

Best regards.
