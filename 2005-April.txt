Subject: [Noteedit-devel] hard crash on midi playing/export fixed
Message-ID: <4251DEAE.3090503@schwaben.de>

Hi all,

after quite some investigations, and although not yet fully 
understanding the inner workings of this area of noteedit, anyway I 
think the attatched fix is a good fix for bug #3503. The tool pmem shows 
that no memory whole is introduced. And things are working again. 3503 I 
closed now, svn rev 69.

I didn't do any cleanup work as a reminder, because similar code 
contructs with segno repeats might show similar problems. This needs to 
be kept an eye on, maybe.

Thanks for the bug report.

Best Regards,
Georg

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] GUI Patch #403
Message-ID: <425446FE.8060301@web.de>

Hi,

This evening I looked into the GUI patch. In contains the following 
changes to make the menu structure more logical:

- "New window" moved to the file menu (probably better to be placed
   below "New"
- Submenu for import and export
- First Import submenu, then Export submenu
- Close All (close all windows) in the file menu
- Comments changed in the edit menu (with errors)
- Setting (staff) moved to the menu Format
- New menu "Format"
- Extras/Tools menu moved to the right of the TSE3 menu
- Output parameters moved to the menu settings
- Swap "Keyboard config" and "Configure noteedit"
- Comment to the help menu (to be corrected).

To test the patch: Save the raw patch as noteeditui.rc and replace
this file from the one in the noteedit subdirectory. If you have
noteedit already installed you might need to replace the installed
file (restoring it should be no problem) as noteedit might use the
installed one instead of the one installed in the noteedit directory.

I'd like to have some feedback before I apply the (modified) patch
to svn. Thanks for your help!

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

If I understsand you correctly, Staff becomes Format? So we should
change add to add staff, remove to remove staff, voices to staff voices
etc. I'd somehow (though it needs a lot of work) merge the voices and
staff properties menu options into one form widget, but this should be a
question for other thread sometime in the future.

Otherwise, I like it. We're finally moving towards a standard outlook of
apps menus.

No, just the menu point "staff properties" was moved to the menu format.
Concerning merging voices and staff properties: We could do that simply
by using tabs. I tend not to completely merge it as this makes the
dialog quite crowded.

Also: Does anyone know if there is a way to move a menu item betwenn
a default menu. I'm currently unable to move "window new" to the place
I want to have it.

But currently, there's no Format menu at all. What other submenus should 
Format include besides staff properties?

About merging voices and staff properties dialog, IMO the best suitable 
option would be to join voices & staff dialogs into single dialog 
including two tabs (one for general/instrument/layout and the other for 
voices). But the options should still be available separately. That is 
click on staff properties submenu would bring you staff properties 
dialog with general tab opened and voices should bring you up staff 
properties dialog with vioces tab opened.

btw. Could you fix a typo "Voice:"->"Instrument:" in Staff properties 
dialog above the instrument list.

Score Layout and Score Information.
I checked the file into svn. You should now be able to take a look
at it for yourself.

Done (Already in svn).
Will take a look at the staff / voices dialogs this evening.

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Design proposal for staff properties
Message-ID: <425D954D.9000208@web.de>

Hi,

I developed a design proposal for the staff properties
(new with voices included). I've included it into the
attachment (use the qt3 (3.3.4) designer to view it).

Due to place restrictions the selection of the staff
name has to be done via combobox instead of tabs. Even
if we do not join staff properties and voice dialog it
would be a good idea to be able to select a different
staff via combobox.

The staff property dialog has a wrong order of the
buttons below. I corrected this as well as the buttons
are no longer on the same height as staff itself.

I don't like the position of the create voice button.
Maybe someone has a better idea how to create a voice.

I also removed the help button as it does not show any
context sensitive help for the staff properties. It's
better to create real context sensitive help with a '?'
icon (using the Whats this functions).

Regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

I like it. It's something very similar I had in mind! I like the new 
delete buttons.

A small bug though: voice numbers (under delete voice buttons) are not 
justified to center.

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Translation question
Message-ID: <425E5100.3080903@guest.arnes.si>

I'm preparing a new version of Slovenian translation and I have two 
questions:
1) Staff->New is a duplicate of File->New. I'd suggest to split these 
commands (add additional argument), because in Slovenian language, there 
should be New document and New staff (just New is not ok, because of 
syntax rules)
2) If you delete a staff (Staff->Delete), there is a warning about 
deleting the voice, not the staff. ("This deletes current voice! Are you 
sure?" string).

I'll send a new translation soon.


Regards.

I fixed some bugs in UI and added some features:
- Staff -> Delete staff warning used Delete voice confirmation. Now it 
uses Delete staff confirmation.
- Staff -> Import recording used This ovverrides current voice 
confirmation. Now it uses current staff confirmation.
- I updated all the translations - I rebuilt them from source (make 
package-messages). This also added the new "Format" menu into .po files 
and updated some pretty old translations.
- Added noteedit.pot - the template for the translators
- Updated Slovenian translation (IMPORTANT!)
- Updated the po/Makefile.in to actually make Slovenian translation work

The attachment consists of:
noteedit/NEWS.patch - updated Slovenian translation, fixed UI bugs etc.
noteedit/noteedit/mainframewidget.cpp.patch - fixed Delete voice -> 
Delete staff warnings
noteedit/po/*.po - updated translations, Slovenian is moslty rewritten
noteedit/po/noteedit.pot - added the template for translators

Hello Matev?,

your work is checked in. I also did now a make package-messages, and it 
only worked with KDEDIR properly set through all the build process. I'm 
still learning how everything works, and wondering why the po- and 
pot-files get again modified against svn.

Anyway, Reinhard added you to the list of developers, hopefully you agree.

Best Regards,
Georg.

Hello. I've been looking for some documentation about how to
execute NoteEdit from command line, but I don't find anything. In "man
noteedit" there are some options to execute some characteristics from
terminal, but it's not enough.

       My idea is to import a midi file from my code and show the score.
so I would like to know how to do it from command line.

       I asked for it in the noteedit-user list, and the administrator
told me to say to you my wish :-) I would like to know if it's posible
to do it.

       Thank you very much.

Yes, I noticed changing sl.po file upon running make package-messages. 
It actually replaces

msgstr "STRING"

with

msgstr ""
"STRING"

, but I don't know why. :( Other translations are left alone.

Yeah, of course I like it:). Does this mean I have a SVN write access as

I have the same problem. It seem to me that messages including "\n"
or having string with several lines. But I also noted that the msgid
has the same format, so the translation should still work (not tested).

Yes and you have more access rights to the project as well like 
Moderator for the forums or admin for all the managers (so you
f.e. can add new categories for a manager).

Hi,
ann
On Friday the 22. April (Tomorrow) I and Georg will hold
an BOFS for noteedit. We will present noteedit to the
interested audience and discuss the current development
progress.

We already collected and discussed some ideas:
- Macros for noteedit making it easier to enter groups
   of notes (somewhat based on feature request #518/519)
- Improve midi input (manual edit mode), can be combined
   with the macros

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzm

Oh well, I forgot the time and the place:
LAC2005 is in Karlsruhe (http://lac.zkm.de)
and the BOFS is at 15.30.
The conference is streamed. See http://lac2005.zkm.de/
for more information.

Thanks and best regards,

Building from the svn subtree is still not functioning. Is there really 
a reason why we don't keep admin files from 2.7.4 version in the current 
trunk tree as well (as described in bug #2814)?

ps. According to the bug discussion, KDE 2 support is IMO not needed 
anymore (J.A. recommended this more than a year ago?!). I'm currently 
aware of only Debian stable distribution, which still includes 2.2.2 
version of KDE (but it doesn't include NoteEdit package - available 
under testing/unstable only, which have KDE 3.3.2 currently).

Not really for me, I just don't know how well they behave on other 
systems. I have managed to get all working with the current kde version
and created admin files with the help of kdevelop. But I had to patch
the noteedit/Makefile.am file to get things running properly.

Can some of you test, if everything runs well with the applied patch ?
If I don't apply the patch I can no longer build noteedit because
libtool does not correctly ignore some of the moc files.

Another issue for me is that the kdevelop project I created has the
problem that the uic (user interface compiler) doesn't get invoked.
make from the console works fine. Also the "run automake and friends"
does not work correctly, only running "make -f Makefile.cvs" manually 
seems to produce the correct configure file.
I have put my current kdevelop files to svn (Requires version 3.1.2). 
Maybe there is a bug in one of the options I changed or something 
different has to be changed to get things working correctly with kdevelop.

I don't really think it is necessary as well. I already thought about
splitting the uiconnect.h/cpp files and making several ui.h files as
it is usually done for QT3 (so subclassing is only neets to be done when 
really needed).

Ok, I cleaned my tree and redownloaded the current svn version and 
applied your patch. But when I invoked make -f Makefile.cvs, I get 
immediate error that libtool.m4.in is not found. When I renamed 
admin/old-* to admin/*, the error was fixed, but got another one:( :

The admin files in svn requires automake 1.4 and probably autoconf 2.1.
I have uploaded admin files I created with Mandriva Linux 10.2. You
can test these as well if you wish.

I downloaded your admin files and make -f Makefile.cvs made a working 
configure script. I ran configure and tried to compile the program. 
Everything worked fine for a while (makefiles were created in subdirs 
correctly), but at the end I got the linking error:

I'm using automake 1.9 (when using 1.4, it said that KDE requires at

Hmm, that error didn't occur to me, maybe the Mandriva folks did somehow
patch KDE or automake to get these things working.

I looked at my Makefile and the Makefile.am. Your problems seems to be
that YYLINENO (i.e. LEX_LINENO), YYRESTART (LEX_RESTART) and YYPARSE
(YACC_PARSE) are not defined in the Makefile. For me they have the
values NEDITlineno, NEDITrestart , NEDITparse. I have not found out
who is generating these three symbols.

Hello Matev?,

nice to see this been done! The noteheads in lilypond (2.4.4) needed to
be lifted one octave higher. I ckecked that in, hopefully you agree with
that. I also added lilypond support for the octaviated soprano clef
variants.

And I unloaded a minor patch into svn that prints an empty stanza number
when we have only one verse of lyrics.

The slowenian translation doesn't build any more. If you can't
reproduce/correct it, I can give you details.

Best Regards,
Georg.

Hi Matev?,

Great work! I tested it out and (with the changes of Georg) found
no principal problem with the Soprano Clef.

I just noted that mup doesn't like clef changes in the mid of the
bar.

Concerning the lilypond output: Clef changes on my Schubert
example are shown before the bar in lilypond but after the
bar in noteedit. One of them has to be wrong...
I've only attached the noteedit file. I'm using lilypond 2.4.6.

I've got no problems with the current slowenian translation.
Note that I compiled the stuff with my own admin changes I
uploaded Friday.

Some more information about this:
In configure.in.in "NEDIT" is defined as PREFIX for LEX/YACC.
After running configure the PREFIX gets added to all the
parse/restart/lineno methods (This is done dynamically when
generating the file noteedit/grammar.cpp and noteedit/lexik.cpp).
So your configure.in and your configure file should have the lines
LEX_PREFIX="NEDIT"
LEX_RESTART="${LEX_PREFIX}restart"
LEX_LINENO="${LEX_PREFIX}lineno"
YACC_PARSE="${LEX_PREFIX}parse"
YACC_LVAL="${LEX_PREFIX}lval"

The noteedit/Makefile already should contain several variable
definitions like
LEX_LINENO = NEDITlineno
LEX_PREFIX = NEDIT
LEX_RESTART = NEDITrestart
and (very important)
PREFIX_DEF = -DYYLINENO=$(LEX_LINENO) -DYYRESTART=$(LEX_RESTART) 
-DYYPARSE=$(YACC_PARSE) -DYYLVAL=$(YACC_LVAL)

and finally lexik.cpp contains the definition for the symbol
/* Substitute the variable and function names.  */
#define yyparse NEDITparse
#define yylex   NEDITlex
#define yyerror NEDITerror
#define yylval  NEDITlval
#define yychar  NEDITchar
#define yydebug NEDITdebug
#define yynerrs NEDITnerrs

Please check all these and tell me if anything is missing. Also
helpful could be warning when creating lexik.cpp or grammar.cpp
concerning the above definitions.

Reinhard Katzmann

Could you be more specific? I made a test with a treble clef long 2.5 
measures, then I placed a soprano clef in the middle of the third 
measure and continued writing in it. I saved, closed NE, open it again 
and it showed fine.

Yes, I noticed, but I don't think it's a bug, it's Lilypond's feature:). 
In NoteEdit, your composition is more technically correct:
For 4 measures, you write in treble clef. The fifth measure is in 
soprano clef. So you place the first element in the fifth measure the 
soprano clef (you closed the 4 measures long segment with a measureline 
and started a new segment in the fifth one). Placing the soprano clef as 
the last element in the fourth measure is nonsense, because a 
measureline doesn't depend on the clef (it doesn't have pitch, so it 
doesn't need it).

Lilypond tries to make the outlook nicer and more readable by the performer:
It ignores the exact position of the clef in .ly file (before or right 
after the measureline), but always places it before the measureline 
where the clef is about to change. Why is it good? Well, the performer 
register it more quickly. And besides it's quite common in literature (I 
checked my Henle's Chopin's Etudes and Edition Peters Czerny's Etudes) 
to place the new clef right before the measure where it changes and not 
in the measure measure itself. That's the LilyPond view.

IMO, this works as it should from the first place. Or did you have 
something else in mind?

Hm... you mean noteedit/lexik.cc? I didn't find those in it. Also 
lexik.ll only has few yylex and yytext phrases, but no 
yyparse/yyerror/yychar and others... Isn't lexik.cc/cpp created from 
lexik.ll by flex? I'm using the current svn's lexik.ll file.

Just use the Schubert piece I sent with the mail and save it.

Here is the error message:

staff 1; measure 5: MUP cannot deal with clef changes in the middle of 
measure

But as I said I think it's a general problem, not something special
about the Soprano clef.

So from the point of view of the mup file noteedit behaves correct.
Only if the user would like to see the position of the clef where
it will be placed by lilypond it'd be a minor issue.

Thanks for the comment and best regards,

Now that's interesting. In my Makefile LEX / YACC is defined as
LEX = flex -l
LEXLIB = -lfl
YACC = bison -y -d

So you are right, lexik.ll is generated by flex. The interesting
thing is how the cc files are created out of the ll files. The
Makefile.am contains some lines including .ll.cc / .yy.cc directives
(i.e. if the makefiles encounters a .ll / .yy file, the corresponding
.cc file is creating by using the commands found in the directive.
Now your problem might have two solutions:

1) Remove the directives from the Makefile.am (they are generated
with newer automake anyway automagically).

2) Remove the automatically generated directives from the Makefile.
Even in my Makefile both directives are present. Not something which
I particulary like. I'll do some test of this on my system as well.

Regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

 From the manpage:

  -l     turns on maximum compatibility with the original AT&T lex imple-
         mentation.  Note that this does  not  mean  full  compatibility.
         Use  of  this option costs a considerable amount of performance,
         and it cannot be used with the -+, -f, -F, -Cf, or -CF  options.
         For  details on the compatibilities it provides, see the section
         "Incompatibilities With Lex And POSIX" below.  This option  also
         results  in  the  name YY_FLEX_LEX_COMPAT being #define'd in the
         generated scanner.

I just show you the lines of Makefile.am:

.yy.cc:
	$(YACC) $(AM_YFLAGS) $(YFLAGS) $<

<more stuff>

.ll.cc:
	$(LEX) -P$(LEX_PREFIX) -olex.yy.c $<
<more stuff>

So to test it you could have removed these two
directives (they are telling the make program
what to do with the (lexik).ll / (grammer).yy files.

I don't have success though when I try that. So
perhabs you should first look for the lines
".yy.cc:" and ".ll.cc:" in the Makefile and
remove the ones not being the same as in the
Makefile.am file.

Currently I don't know how to tell automake not
to automatically place them into the Makefile.

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Qt Port of Mainwindow and menu
Message-ID: <426C17B1.6070108@web.de>

Hi,

I started the port of the main window to raw Qt. I looked
into mainframewidget.cpp and found out that the code base
doesn't seem to be too difficult to move back for these
components. I includeded a designer ui file for a first
impression. I used the KDE crystalsvg icons as a base,
this can of course be changed if you know similar good
looking icons.

I also made several small corrections to the menus and
started grouping some of the insert of notes and other
musical symbols. There is a technical problem to this
though as you know longer see that you have selected
one of the symbols of such a group to be inserted (i.e.
you see which symbol is selected but not that you
have selected the group for input). This probably can
be worked around as a Toolbar is a Dockwindow where
other widgets could be added as well.

Of course several toolbars are still missing and some
menu points have to be added (Qt requires for every
toolbar item one menu item), and of course all the slots
for the menu have to be added to the mainwindow.ui.h file.

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Is there a way to make this configurable? I would find it sad if the
integration into kde would be removed. I tend to respect the work the
authers of noteedit did ...

Persoonally I don't need the integration, but I just imagine the shuffle
of files on the Desktop to call noteedit might be easier. More
substantial critic I can't give in the moment. The option to be able to
run without kde is a plus, of course.

Best Regards,
Georg.

Hi,

I'd suggest we bring out a new 2.7.5 release (or 2.8.0 ) before I start 
doing to many change to the user interface for Feature Request #310.
After that I would make a 2.8 branch for the current stable release
and 2.9 for the development just on the above feature, so changes
to 2.8 can be easily merged into 2.9. I'll try to finish the
Voices / Staff properties integration this week.

Theoretically we could maintain both a Qt and KDE Version of NoteEdit
but I think it would mean quite some work to keep both versions as
not only for the main window and the menu there has to be code doubled
but also for file dialogs, settings, standard dialogs etc.
Of course I do respect the works of the original noteedit author(s)
as well. Going to pure Qt will make things a little bit more 
complicated. OTOH it is much easier to port to other platforms after
this step as we are only dependent on one user interface API.

Concerning the KDE integration maybe we could support a minimal
desktop integration (mainly for theming and such). It would have
to be done in a way that these addons can be switched easily with
#ifdef KDE. Other things like Midi / TSE3 / arts (the audio integration)
is a completely different topic I would not change at this time.

Yes, I think we should release 2.8.0 version and split the 
stable/unstable branches immediately. I have a question about Qt though: 
Are there any big API differences between Qt3.x and Qt4.x 
APIs/libraries? Because Qt4.0 has a release date in June afaik.

Indeed there are big differences between Qt4.0 and the current one.
They build in a compatibility layer so the developers can slowly
switch to the new Qt4.0 API. Also the designer has changed a lot
in it's functionality (as I read last there was no longer a possibility
to code with the designer). They have split up the library. Many
of the classes which were not accessible without subclassing are
no accessible, OTOH several classes were removed AFAIK.

I'll try to get a beta release ready at the weekend so we get
the release out quite soon. I'll set the version on the corresponding
files if no one has time this week to do this.

Concerning the split: You should check out the 2.8.0 branch as soon
as I created it. The "HEAD" branch will then be the 2.9.0. I'll
give some instructions as soon as I have done it.

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Hi Matev?,

I'm puzzled, a score block of a piano staff now looks more like

\score {
        \relative <<
                \context GrandStaff = cStaffAA <<
                        \context Staff = cStaffAA <<
                                \context Voice = cStaffAA \StaffA
                        >>

                        \context Staff = cStaffBB <<
                                \context Voice = cStaffBB \StaffB
                        >>
                >>

                \set Score.skipBars = ##t
                \set Score.melismaBusyProperties = #'()
        >>
        \layout {
                linewidth = 170.000 \mm
                textheight = 250.000 \mm
        }
}

I would fix it, but I guess you might happen to have grabbed an old
version of noteedit, or your lilypond is not found?
Best Regards,
Georg.

Hi,

so I also tried a clean svn build with an copied-over admin-tarball, and

midimapper.cpp could be removed with Reinhard's patch patch_Makefile.am,
but now it fails also with

When someone generates a patch I could run this further. I'm here on

Hi Georg,

Thanks for the feedback! Yesterday I added a workaround in the
filehandler.cpp to solve the problem for me and when I this
morning thought about it I finally found out the reason:
I had removed a critical dependency to filehandler.lo in the
Makefile.am! So again I append the corrected Makefile.am to
this mail. If nothing goes wrong anymore I upload this to svn.

Thanks for all the help!

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] MultiRest issues resolved
Message-ID: <426E40A5.3080102@guest.arnes.si>

Hello to all.

I finally resolved multirest issues. They are now numbered correctly and 
their length is set according to the current time signature. I tried 
Lily export and it works fine. Measure numberings in NE are the same as 
Lily's. Note that inserting a multirest + key signature/clef + 
measureline works as well (my patch yesterday needed explicetly 
multirest + measureline in order to make measures numberings work). I 
also attached a screenshot of NE & multirests in action.

I'm not sure if my patches were the best possible solutions to problems, 
but elementary they work this way:
- #3862 - measures after multirests not numbered correctly:
When placing a barline (of any type) NE now checks if any element of 
getType()==T_REST and getSubType()==MULTIREST exists in previous measure 
(an iterration until a measureline of any kind is found or the beginning 
of the document). If found, than place the measureLine with 
numbering+=lengthOfMultiRest (ie. the number of measures that mulitrest 
is long). If not, then make an ordanary measureline with numbering++.
- #3861 - Multirests in non-4/4 measure broken:
When placing a Multirest, its length_ variable (rest length in MIDI 
units) was set to voice->getStaff()->staff_props->getMeasureLength() 
multiplied by lengthOfMultiRest (number of measures). That would be 
fine, if getMeasureLength() would be properly set. But it was set to a 
constant 4*QUARTER_LENGTH. What I made was a new function 
NVoice::getCurrentMeasureMidiLength(), which tries to find the first 
time signature from that element backwards. It iterated until the time 
signature or the beginning of document was found. If found, it returned 
the correctly calculated measure length. If not found, it returned the 
default 4*QUARTER_LENGTH. Now, the getMeasureLength() is calculated by 
calling NVoice::getCurrentMeasureMidiLength() and is not set to a 
constant anymore.

What I'd like to know is if these patches are implemented correctly. Or 
are these functions and principles I took already implemented somewhere? 
In anyway, please test:-)

HiMatev?,

thanks! It's very nice to have this, great work, I'll use it. When I
have time I'll test it more. On the first glance it just works. Your
code I'll study, which will teach me more about the inner workings. And
thanks for the screenshot, it looked nice.

More on this soon hopefully,
Regards,
Georg.

Does anyone know if Berlios offers any non-public wikies? I'd like to

wouldn't like them to be available to non-NoteEdit developers. I have a 
completely different UI in mind, different file formats for saving the 
score, the whole new NE API for making scripts&macros, which includes 
replacement for most of the inner parts of the current NE (yesterday 
multirest's implementation gave me a headache because of NE's clumsyness 
for eg.), different MIDI output and interaction etc. Since this mailing 
list is public, I wouldn't like to discuss them here, cause I'm a bit 
affraid that big brother's watching, oops reading us:-).

Berlios itself does not offer non-public wikies. But we can add our
own wiki to the noteedit homepage.

Concerning Midi I have also some ideas, but I have to investigate
first a little bit further the whole thing before I can make a concept.

Berlios does not allow to create "Private" Mailing lists.  As far as I 
see the TOS of Berlios do not forbid to set up disclosed pages for 
development. So if you really want to have a disclosed place for
discussion (I personally don't mind about it) it would be possible with
a closed forum or wiki.

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Apply + Cancel on Properties / Dialogs
Message-ID: <426FE9A3.8020703@web.de>

Hi,

While working on joining Staff properties and the voice
dialog I noticed some very unusual behaviour of noteedit:

If you press "Apply" the properties are globally saved.
If you press "Cancel" afterwards the previous properties are
restored.

All the applications I know of have the following behaviour:
If you press "Apply" the properties are globally saved.
Pressing Cancel does not restore the previous values.
Several programms additionally
- Disable Apply/Cancel if no property was changed
- Disable Apply/Cancel if apply was pressed.

Do you know if this is a usual noteedit behaviour
and why this is done this way ?

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Hi Matev?,

a look through your patches gave me confidence that things are working
better than before. It's well done. Though I will test more on
multirests the time coming. Btw., recently I tried to fix #3503 (abc
export bug), because I thought I could do it, but got stucked. Maybe a
search backwards like you did it for multirest would give me there a
solution.

I did in the meantime some little cleaning, just things I stumbled over
recently:
-- A few printf's for midi-debugging are disabled. They could overflow
the KDE-console (relevant when startet from a desktop icon) that
noteedit would crash after a long and heavy session.
-- In lilyexport text markups go now without \fattext, so texts by
default will not influence the horizontal spacing of notes. This is what
I we most of the time want, I think.
-- The tie (~) is written before the octaviation command, so lilypond
will not choke on this anymore.

Best Regards,
Georg.

I took a deeper thought into this. I guess it would be good
to test the values on the screen for the user before really
applying it. There are two possibilities for that:

- Save every value twice in the staffPropFrm class
- When changing a value show the changes at once in the
   mainframe widget.

I tend to do the second as you can still Cancel your complete
action and see the effects of your change.

In the other case I would have to add a "Test" button so it is
possible to test the values before applying them. Maybe it is
even better to rename the "Apply" button to "Test".

What do you think?

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Ugh. I hate this kind of bugs, mostly because of weak NoteEdit structure 
:(. I didn't dig into the bug though, but I persume that NoteEdit 
doesn't have a function that would return you the notes that are in 
timing above the current, in other voice (chord). You could then seek 
the previous element of every first-voice note (above the current one) 
and if this element is a measureline or similar, then the measureline 
should be before the current note as well.
The other way I'd prefer more, is that measurelines of any kind should 
be written in non-first voices as well. This would easily resolve RFE (I 
don't remember the number), which suggested writing measurelines in 
non-first voices as well.
All in all, everything above should require a thought or two thoughts 
more:). I hope you have some better ideas than I do in the moment!

That's great.

Yes, that's fine IMO. Although NE shows FatText all the time in UI.

I have a feeling that NEWS file is getting mature for the new release:).

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] fixed some bugs...
Message-ID: <4272D379.90106@guest.arnes.si>

I fixed and updated the following bugs/areas:
- Do you want to save changes dialog, when hitting close button (in 
titlebar, not by File-->Quit) ignored the Cancel hit. Therefore, if you 
made a change and quit by using the X button, NE asked you that you have 
unsaved changes, but if you hit cancel, it exited anyway. This is now fixed.
- When deleting an element and having the next element non-playable 
(measureline), NE didn't mark document as edited. Second, when selecting 
a region, and hitting Del key, NE ignored it. Only Backspace worked for 
deleting a region. Third, hitting Del or Backspace when no elements 
selected always marked document as non-edited (although you could make 
changes to the document before). Last but not least, I implemented a 
rule that if using Del key, it works only until you reach the end of 
document. This way, holding Del key won't delete the whole staff if you 
hold it too long. Backspace does though.
- Last bar numberings were wrong until at least version 2.7.1. Last bar 
number was always one ahead than actual bar number (the endbar number). 
This way, Edit-->Goto bar option always showed you the last bar number 
increased by one. This was because bar numberings used barNr_++ and not 
++barNr_, whereas the initial value of barNr_ should be 1 and not 2. 
This works now as it should.
- One click MIDI import implemented using File-->Import-->MIDI import. 
It's actually only a shortcut to TSE3-->MIDI In and 
TSE3-->TSE3toDocument. If all goes well, it brings you a nice notice 
that you should use Edit-->Autobar & Autobeam and other tools for making 
score nicer or you should take a look in documentation for further 
details. The downside is that it uses the TSE3 score for MIDI import. So 
if you already have any scores currently loaded in TSE3, it will be 
lost. I also updated the .po files to include this notice.

Please test and report any spotted bugs:). I think NE is mature for a 
new release? (2.7.5)


Best wishes!

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Makefile.am for icons directory
Message-ID: <4273A951.9090007@web.de>

Hi,

I changed the Makefile.am in the icons directory.
When installing Noteedit an error occured when
installing it. Reason is that $datadir references
$kde_datadir and this variable again references
$datadir. I changed $datadir to $(prefix)/share/apps.

I know it's not the best solution in case $kde_datadir
changes one day but I didn't find other way around
the recursion problem.

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] double quotes allowed
Message-ID: <4273EED9.4080705@guest.arnes.si>

Sorry for being annoying again, but bringing some good news I hope ... :)

Double quotes (") can now be used in score title, composer, comments
etc. now. Also, staff names can have them too. I also updated Lily and
ABC export filters, which caused troubles if you used them. MID,
MusicXML, PMX and MusiXTeX export worked fine.

Please test and fetch any bugs. A nice screenshot showing the working 
double quotes attached.
btw. Is there a way, I could update our site a bit. I'd like to clean 
the FAQ area and bring a little life to the NE site.

Georg, using LilyExport (2.4.5) and Choir staff I get an
error if using non-default staff names and lyrics (something messed up 
with voice names or something). Could you check it out please? If you 
won't I'll do it myself though in the following days, but I think you're 
more familiar with things there at the moment:).
