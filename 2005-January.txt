Subject: [Noteedit-devel] 2.7.4 release
Message-ID: <200501161629.35032.leon.vinken@hetnet.nl>

Hi all,

in order to create/maintain our credibility as NoteEdit maintainers, I think 
we should release new versions regularly. Therefore I propose to fix a few 
more bugs, and then release 2.7.4.

As far as I am concerned, we should fix at least the easy bugs and then 
release a new version within a few weeks. As always, I am willing to help.

Comments, offers for help and suggestions about what to fix an when to release 
are welcome.

Best regards, Leon.

Hi all,

I have assigned bugs 2581, 2807 and 2809 to myself and intend to fix them in 
time for inclusion in 2.7.4.

Hi all,

does anyone knows the status of patch #255 (uploaded by whiteangel on nov 
26) ? Should that be merged in before the next release ? Can anyone verify 
it's correctness ?

Yes, I uploaded it few months ago. It mainly fixes the LilyPond export 
stuff (adds \version "2.0", so the convert-ly works out of the box and 
fixes few idents, so the contexts are ligned up correctly in multi-voice 
scores).

Hi Leon,

I appreciate very much your release proposals. That makes sense.

I think the LAC in april in Karlsruhe is also an event to show noteedit 
is alive, and I hope to put a poster there. Last year I attended one 
day, and it was very interesting, and fun.

In my vacations I did some adaptions to lilypond 2.4 export. This gives 
nice lyrics printout, with many verses possible over and beneath the 
score. But instead of spreading many if's for the different lily 
versions, I propose to duplicate NLilyExport::exportStaffs() in 
lilyexport.cpp for lilypond >= 2.4. I'm afraid to damage export for 
older lily's, which I don't have nor test. Does anyone have a thought 
about that? I think we should have two of them. lily develops nicely, 
with many (small) changes.

At the weekend I did some arranging, and suddenly triples input didn't 
work anymore: It works only with mouse input, not by external midi 
keyboard, or vkeybd, if you don't have a real one. Leon, could you look 
at this, maybe?

Something more: My devel machine is a suse 9.2 x64, and my build process 
is adventerous. The suse provided noteedit-2.7.3 rpm builds by itself, 
thanks. It includes a patch. This is my base. What works is 1) download 
svn repository from berlios 2) apply the patch from suse rpm 3) workout 
the commands according to the suse spec file. Although this beeing very 
intuitive it gives me atleast a working noteedit. The documentation is 
far from that. The bones of my script are:

    cd noteedit
    cp /usr/src/packages/SOURCES/noteedit-2.7.3/configure.in .
    cp /usr/src/packages/SOURCES/noteedit-2.7.3/Makefile.in .
    patch -p1 < /usr/src/packages/SOURCES/noteedit-2.7.3.dif
    cp /opt/kde3/share/apps/kdelibs/admin/acinclude.m4.in acinclude.m4
    libtoolize --force
    aclocal
    autoconf
    ./configure --prefix=/opt/kde3 --libdir=/opt/kde3/lib64 
--with-qt-libraries=/usr/lib/qt3/lib64 \
        --disable-final --with-libtse3-libs=/usr/lib64
    make

How should we deal with that magic? Should I try something? Maybe to 
postpone it for later?

Best Regards,
Georg.

OK,

I will have a look at it and merge it into the source tree. Please note that I 
don't use LilyPond, so I cannot verify I did it correctly.

That would probably be workable, but I suspect it would lead to a large code 
duplication. I am not fundamentally against that, but we should try to avoid 
it. Note that I don't have an easy way out either. The best solution depends 
on the amount of common code anyway.

Possible other solutions might be to put all the required if's in anyway and 
do regression testing to verify nothing is broken.

Or, do it the object-oriented way: create a LilyPond export class containing 
the common code, and use inheritance to support the differences required for 
the different versions. Never tried this myself, don't know if it would work.

For the time being I don't completely understand your problem. Is it releated 
to my triplet changes ? What exactly happens ? How can I reproduce it ? Could 
you send more info off-list ?

Would it help if we merged the Suse patch into the source tree, if possible ? 
Building the SVN tree is still an issue that should be solved IMHO. For the 
time being I also build by starting with the 2.7.3 tarball and adding the 
changed sources.

Hi Leon,

the easy answers come here immediately:

>>It works only with mouse input, not by external midi
>>keyboard, or vkeybd, if you don't have a real one. Leon, could you look
>>at this, maybe?
>>

In other words: I discovered that triplet input works only when you 
insert notes with the mouse, not with the midi keyboard. This is in non 
edit mode, of course. If you want to see it: start noteedit, kaconnect 
and vkeybd. Connect in kaconnect vkeybd (in my setup usually 131:0) with 
noteedit (usually 130:0). When you press the black keyboard icon in 
noteedit you should hear the playing from vkeybd. When you press the red 
keyboard icon in noteedit you can enter notes like you do with the mouse.

>Is it releated to my triplet changes ? What exactly happens ?

The setting of the triplet icon is just ignored when the triplet notes 
come from vkeybd. (With an external keyboard it's very convenient to 
insert chords.) Triplets insert works now atleast better.

Hi Georg,

currently I am in the process of downloading both vkeybd and kaconnect. If 
these work, I will try to fix the bug. Never used them before, therefore no 
time estimate yet. Could you file a bug report for this problem ?

Thanks, Leon.

tonight I've committed almost the complete fix for bug 2807 (rests with 
fermatas).

NoteEdit now supports editing rests with fermatas and writing these 
in .abc, .not, .ly (untested), .tex (untested) and .xml format. Writing 
in .pmx format is not supported. Reading in .xml format is supported.

As I am not familiar with lex and yacc, it would cost me a significant amount 
time to also implement reading in .not format. Could someone else please do 
that ?

The small print: I don't use either MusixTeX or LilyPond, thus the 
implementation is untested and may be incorrect. Please report any problems. 
Furthermore, I (arbitrarily) decided to support fermatas only on normal rests 
and not on multirests.

Enjoy, Leon.

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] lily-2.4 export added
Message-ID: <41F77029.1040705@schwaben.de>

Hi all,

I added export in lilypond-2.4.2 format, older versions are not 
affected/corrected at all. Lyrics get typset much nicer now.

Corrections were done in octave-lowered violin clef, syncing of lyrics 
with tie-melismas. Slur melismas still go out of sync, but they are not 
needed so heavily. This needs more investigation. A tempo assignment 
makes lily choking, needs maybe a newer lily. Export of drum note heads 
is incomplete. Whole bar rests in three beat bars (maybe only after four 
beat music) should be exported with r2., not r1.

And, we have a lot of if's in lilyexport. After the 2.4 release we 
should consider to drop support for lily 1.x. Any comments?

I'm considering to change the syntax of the score layout section that I 
can easily adopt the lilypond file to move the lyrics also above the 
notes. This syntax is a bit wired, but I think it might be good that 
noteedit gives in default already the hint how to do that.

What might be annoying: If there is no alsa-midi synthesizer up and 
running, noteedit is crashing without comment. This might scare people 
away. A printf somewhere is minimum, better a window in case you start 
through a desktop icon. Who might do that? If I'm more familiar with 
noteedit I will consider to work more with bug-assignment on berlios ...

Anyway, enjoy,
and Best Regards.
Georg Rudolph.

Did you change the \version to "2.4.2" in the beginning of the export?

I'm not sure how lyrics are treated in NoteEdit, but LilyPond has the 
following:
- every blank is a new note, multiple blanks one after another are 
ignored and are treated as one
- for melisma __ (double underline) is used, but doesn't take an extra 
note for that. eg. If you want to express "Oh_______________ the days." 
(and Oh is melisma long 5 notes) in Lily, you make a slur (start of 
melisma) and on the note that starts the slur, you write Oh and then __ 
(means the start of melisma, the underline will hold until the end of 
slur) and later the days (two normal separated notes): Oh __ the days.
- if you want to divide a single word's sylables to more than one note, 
the -- (double dash) is used and again doesn't need an extra note for 
that. eg. If you want to express "Li - ly - pond rules!" (4 notes), the 
syntax should be Li -- ly -- pond rules!
- ties are treated the same as slurs; you can write melisma or treat it 
as a single note which doesn't need it

For rests, there is a common notation nowadays (and don't ask me why, 
because it's stupid and harder to read IMHO) that if a certain measure 
is empty (doesn't contain any notes), it has the whole rest which means 
that this measure is really empty (despite the actual number of 
beats/length of the measure).

1.x is IMO dead for quite some time now. 3.0 is being actively developed 
in the moment (and the most exciting new feature that I'm waiting for a 
few years already is utf-8 support!:)), but is at least 6 months away.

LilyPond also offers a separate context for lyrics which is independent 
to actual staves, but can connect to certain real voices as well. I'd 
think more in that way. So we should have something like
Insert--Context--Staff
               --Lyrics
               --Chords
               --Tablature
               --GeneralBas markings
               --Harmonics

Which is more or less the LilyPond syntax already. Applying certain 
Lyrics to voice as I said should be also possible if not necessary.
A few brainstorming ideas for the future:).

Hi Georg,

nice work. This means that besides bug fixes we also have a feature for the 
next release.

Could you also add a note to the documentation explaining which Lily versions 
are supported and to what level?

Regards, Leon.

Yes, when it detects a lily >= 2.4.0, and in all others cases \version 
"2.0.3", even when it exports for older lilies. It's okay, I think.

Thank you very much for your valuable explanation. I'll study it, learn

So r1 in a three beat bar should be accepted by lily 2.4.2, no 
correction in noteedit neccessary?

Maybe I'll post my proposal of the syntax template, and you might check 
it then ...

No, Lily wouldn't accept it (I tested with 2.4.2 and it doesn't work). 
Above, I only tried to explain how the notation usually looks nowadays 
(LilyPond output actually). But for Lily input, it's necessary to insert 
exact values (that is r2. (half dotted rest) for full measure length 
rest in 3/4 beat). I'm not aware of the NoteEdit bug, so I apologize for 
the misconception.

That would be a good idea. I'm working on a project of mine (still at 
blueprints and numerous tests, but thinking a lot:)) meant as a perfect 
composition tool. I've taken the concept of staves, lyrics etc. from 
LilyPond and I think it is the best around (comparing to Finale or the 
typesetting programs abc and musicxml). That's why I put so much 
preasure on this, because NoteEdit currently is very close to this 
perfect composition tool already (ie. the freedom  of inserting clefs, 
measure lines, MIDI commands, text signs) and I already made some good 
music with it. The downside of NoteEdit is however, ugly not-commented 
C++ code and KDE non-portability. But as this is free software, the 
first can be fixed, and the second is not conserning us as developers 
neither as composers.

Hi Leon,

could you maybe give me a hint to open which file and with which tool 
(???) to edit the documentation? I guess some file in noteedit/doc, and  
I guessed already too much :). What should I read?

Georg,

that is:
doc/noteedit/index.docbook (English version)
doc/de/index.docbook (German version)
doc/de/de.po (not sure about this one)

Note that I already made minor changes to the English manual, to reflect 
NoteEdit's new home and maintainers. These still need to be translated into 
German. Please do so, as my German is not good enough for error-free writing.

Regards, Leon.

Hi all,

it seems I am running out of simple things to fix. Therefore i would like to 
create the 2.7.4 release shortly. Are there things anyone is doing that needs 
to be done before 2.7.4 ? If so, please let me know a.s.a.p.

At least the documentation (user manual) still needs a few updates, which are 
waiting for a native German speaker.

Lacking volunteers to fix the file loader, I plan to finish bug 2807 myself. 
May take a few days.

Regards, Leon.

To do a release is okay, because 2.7.4 will only be better than 2.7.3. 
For me anyway better :)

Tomorrow hopefully, I'll do that.

As I understood the build procedure is not yet updated sufficiently, 
I'll test that it installs on a kernl 2.4 system according to J?rgs 
documentation. And I'll also test if the new tarball will work when 
dropped in the Suse 9.2 rpm, without modifying the spec file and the 
acompanying patch.

Georg.

yes, I've finally discovered how to persuade the Yacc code to also read .not

please test ...

Hi all,

does anyone know how to edit index.docbook in an editor with 
preview/wysiwig? I searched around, and I can't believe to edit docbook 
documentation isn't comfortable and easy. Maybe I just don't know how to 
start one of the many editors I got, may I first have to load a proper 
style sheet? Any hint is appreciated.

2.7.4 version.

Thanks, checked into svn. Could you also send a patch of 
noteedit/po/Makefile.in, where you probably have to connect it to the 
build process, or somebody else?

Regards,
Georg.

Hi NoteEdit developers,

if you want to, please add your name to the list of NoteEdit developer's 
before we release 2.7.4. Changes should be in AUTHORS (of course) and 
noteedit/noteedit_part.cpp (NoteeditFactory::aboutData(), the info shown by 
help/about).

Regards, Leon.

Georg,

yesterday I compiled both vkeybd and kaconnect without problems. Apparently 
there is an issue with my ALSA setup, because both fail with the message 
"ALSA lib seq_hw.c:446:(snd_seq_hw_open) open /dev/snd/seq failed: No such 
file or directory". For the time being I don't know how to solve that.

Won't be able to make much progress on bug #3088 ...

In case you are familiar with ALSA: my setup is Fedora Core 3, on-board AC97 
audio. /dev/snd only contains control, pcm and timer devices.

Regards, Leon.

Hi Michael,

Welcome to the club ;-) I've added you as a developer to the project.
We're close to release 2.7.4 though I have not much time currently
to help on that (no problem to create tarballs for me). The main
problems I encountered are project management with KDE.

When you have checked out the current SVN code you could either
try to use the configure scripts inclued in the 2.7.3 archive or

- Create a new "noteedit" project with kdevelop
- Copy the SVN directory (I call it noteedit_work, a working copy)
- Copy the admin files and the Makefile.cvs to the working copy.
- Try to build it: make -f Makefile.cvs, ./configure.
- Check if Makefiles were created for doc and noteedit directory.
   if not add some line to configure.in:

AC_CONFIG_FILES([ doc/Makefile ])
AC_CONFIG_FILES([ doc/de/Makefile ])
AC_CONFIG_FILES([ doc/noteedit/Makefile ])
AC_CONFIG_FILES([ kguitar_excerpt/Makefile ])
AC_CONFIG_FILES([ noteedit/Makefile ])
AC_CONFIG_FILES([ noteedit/icons/Makefile ])
AC_CONFIG_FILES([ noteedit/resources/Makefile ])
AC_CONFIG_FILES([ po/Makefile ])

These have to be added after the line
AC_CONFIG_FILES([ Makefile ])

Try to 'make' it.

QT: The user interface is created from XML files
uic take a .ui files and generated .cpp / .h files.

KDE: Don't have much experience with KDE development myself.

If you have a good idea for solving the build nightmare ;-)
just drop us a note on the devel ML.

You can also try to use kdevelop as integrated development
environment. It has gdb support.

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

This can be easily solved. You need to modprobe snd-seq drivers like
snd-seq
snd-seq-dummy
snd-seq-midi-emul
snd-seq-virmidi      --> Virtual Midi in case you don't have "real" Midi
snd-seq-instr
snd-seq-midi-event
snd-seq-device
snd-seq-midi

vkeybd works fine with that.

You might want to add some of these to /etc/modules (2.4.x) or 
/etc/modprobe.preload (2.6.x).

I've installed Fedora Core 3 today and want to test the KDE installation 
as well as my external USB sound card (24 Bit 96 Khz) with Noteedit.

You can also try the sound server jack(it) as alternative to arts or 
esd. Take a look at qjackctl.sf.net. You might want to have the 
realtime-lsm module installed, see www.joq,us "Linux Audio kernel modules".
