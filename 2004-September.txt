Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Continued Development of Noteedit
Message-ID: <41473CA2.9060000@web.de>

Hi,

Noteedit is a great tool for note editing. I'm using it since years
and have experienced many improvements in the course of the
development. I had occasional contact with the creator of noteedit,
Joerg Anders and had the pleasure to meet him himself at the
Linuxtag 2003 in Karlsruhe. I'm regretting that Joerg Anders has
decided to quit the development of noteedit.

I'm planning to become one of the project leaders for noteedit. I have
made some plans for the project management and have several ideas
how to continue development:

- create project page on developer.berlios.de    - Done
- create two mailing lists: Developer and User   - Done for Developer
- create bugtracking system                      - Done
- create patch system (integrate with bugtracking ?)
   (including version to be patched)              - Done (separately)
- upload current version                         - Done
- create and configure subversion
- import source files into subversion directory
- contact authors of noteedit about these plans  - Done by this mail
- develop overview of source code
- subversion daily changes ?
- changelog of old versions ?
- todo list
- development environment: kdevelop
- developer documentation for noteedit
- Improve FAQs and HOWTOs further

Aside from the main development I also plan to compare noteedit with
similar programs available for Linux like rosegarden, denemo (a
frontend for lilypond). I think it is important for noteedit to
be able to exchange data with these programs not only using midi
but also formats like musixml.

I want to make it easier for users to print from noteedit. Currently
you have to export to a format like lilypond or pmx and must call
the program manually before you are able to print the result to the
printer. I think it is better to do it similar to lyx: You have
several print options (lilypond as default) and preview options like
dvi, ps, pdf. Also it could be useful to have mup (the noteedit
interpreter for the noteedit format) as external program to automate
"building" of pdf or ps files to print them.

Everyone being interested in the continued development of noteedit
should not hesitate to comment on this mail or to contact me directly.
The goals should be to improve the ease of use of the program while
keeping the spirit of the current version intact (i.e. no redesign
of the user interface or similar). This way it noteedit will continue
to be the most useful free musicial notation program for Linux.

The project page is http://developer.berlios.de/projects/noteedit
To join the project you currently have to mail me your berlios
account login so I can add you to the lists of developers.

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] SVN trunk imported
Message-ID: <4148A067.2000605@web.de>

Hi!

I've imported the current version of noteedit into SVN.
You can browse the repository via the webpage and
checkout a local copy. To checkin you have to use your
username and password (see SVN page for more information).

I recommand to use the svn client eSvn (http://esvn.umputun.com/)
The only thing I haven't found out if it is possible to specify
the password on the user interface instead in the console.

If you encounter DB errors while browsing or when trying to commit
you have to ssh to svn.berlios.de with your username and password
and do a svnadmin recover /svnroot/repos/noteedit.

Have fun while developing!

Reinhard

Actually I have a small todo list but these are more administrative
task for a project manager and for developer who wish to start coding
on noteedit. I want to use the berlios "feature request" manager
( http://developer.berlios.de/feature/?group_id=2232 ) to manage the
todo list. We can always put the current status of it on the "TODO"
file which is in SVN.

I don't think this is necessary as there already is a QT port for
Cygwin available as well as kde (kdiff3 f.e. is a kde application
ported to native windows, i.e. doesn't need X11).

I agree that MIDI improvement could be done. I don't know enough
about TSE3 to decide if it is platform independent. SDL seems to
be the better option here. OTOH tse3 play features would have to
be ported to SDL.

Currently I can't tell you how deep KDE and QT are integrated into
noteedit. The user interface itself is only one aspect. QT offers
itself many additional features (Strings, Dynamic Arrays, Pointer Lists
etc.) which might make it much more complicated to port it to wxWidgets
or GTK.

Of course that it is! My main roadmap currently is to fix bugs and make
some smaller improvements to printing. Everything else will require a
deeper dive for me into noteedit internals.

OK, we'll do some code inspection this weekend and continue with
proposals.

I agree that code stabilisation/bug fixing and printing support should go
first. SDL port can follow afterwards on dedicated svn branch.

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] lyrics and ties at lilypond export
Message-ID: <414F07E6.7060806@schwaben.de>

Hi all,

there is a problem with lyrics when exported to lilypond I would like to 
fix.

I looked around, and I think the problem is that noteedit, when 
exporting lyrics under a note with a tie, is putting an extra underscore 
after the syllable under the tied note. But lilypond obviously takes 
already care of the syllable extension. Currently the lyrics get 
shifted, incrementally after each note with a tie.

I think in file noteedit/lilyexport.cpp at the places processing the 
underscores

   out_ << " _ ";

the property hasATie() should be taken in consideration. I attached a 
two small files for testing:
tie_problem.not:        2 staffs with lyrics
tie_problem.ly:           exported file for lilypond, but removed "_" 
befor "to- day" in the second staff by hand.

You can compare the lyrics in both staffs when you run the .ly file 
through lilypond. Hopefully soon I will come to it to make a patch.
Best Regards,
Georg

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Noteedit Homepage
Message-ID: <4151BDC7.30009@web.de>

Hi,

As Mr. Anders has deleted the homepage of noteedit we currently
lack a proper homepage. I found the homepage very good from the
content point of view, the layout and design was quit good as far
as I remember, but in way that I sometimes forgot to download the 
documentation or to look for some important hints.

I hope that Mr Anders grants us access to his original homepage,
or that someone on the list here has a quite recent copy of the
page. Particulary the screenshots and several hints for the normal
user were on this page and might not be in the archive (I'm not
sure about it, I have never compared the archive content to the
homepage content).

The alternative option would be to create a complete new homepage
(which means basically to develop a new layout, design and content).

What are your opinions ?
I would only choose the last option if we don't get access to the
original homepage.

Best Regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

I like this option.
Create a new homepage from scratch. The original homepage was very poluted, 
and all in a unique file.

A good option (in my opinion) is drupal.org , very useful for menage projects 
pages with colaboration for write, and costumizable look. Else has a module 
for create hyerarchical menus.

I have no copy. But perhaps I can find the page in our backup
system.

It is my serious opinion NoteEdit should die if it is so
consequently ignored by the LAU list (see below).

I'll search in backup system. But don't misunderstand me:
I placed a link to the berlios page at the old noteedit URL.
But do not expect too much help from me. If I find the pages
I'll send them to you. If you don't hear from me till monday,
you should assume I haven't found it.

I append the discontinuation FAQ, which contains still more
aspects and at the end a statement which could eventually
influence your development.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Discontinuation FAQ
===================


Q: I read about the "unclear statements". How did those LAU
    posts lead to stopping development?

A: Note! The mails are form LAU list. The leading list for
    opinions concerning audio on Linux which has great influence on
    all Linux users and distributers.

    I do not really believe, there will be a Finale port on Linux.
    But there is a small probability especially if so many LAU members
    have the fondest wish to overcome tools like NoteEdit as that LAU
    thread suggests and if they send appropriate requests to Codamusic.
    And that would certainly stop NoteEdit usage.

  ----------------------------------------------------------

Q: But Finale will never be free!

A: Please remember the history of StarOffice, the predecessor of
    OpenOffice. Despite of the situation on MS-Windows, the Linux
    version was always free of charge. Because Finale-NotePad is free
    on MS-Windows, too, there is certain probability for a free
    variant of Finale(-NotePad) on Linux.

  -----------------------------------------------------------

Q: I don't read that thread like you do. In all, perhaps three
    people were seriously interested in Finale for Linux!

A: Ok, this is an aspect. But you cannot disavow the LAU list
    consequently ignores NoteEdit. Read a very typical thread starting
    here:

       http://eca.cx/lau/2004/01/0119.html

    A user asks for "music editing software". In my ears it sounds
    like "NoteEdit". But trace the thread of 28 mails! NoteEdit is
    neither mentioned nor recommended. But I thought somebody would at
    least mention the word "NoteEdit". Ok, I could post the word. But,
    if I, the author, am the one and only person who has this
    association, why continue NoteEdit?

    And do not answer this is a bad example! If you wish I can search
    for more threads.

    And it has practical consequences. NoteEdit was never part of the
    official Red Hat or Fedora distribution. And it is quite clear
    why: I assume the Fedora packers are not musicians. So they cannot
    estimate the different musical score software packages. Indeed,
    SuSE was the one and only distributer who packed NoteEdit in a
    very early stage. And again I can tell you why: The person
    responsible for the SuSE sound packages is a musician. He does not
    depend on the LAU opinion. And he posted the one and only clear
    NoteEdit statement:

       http://eca.cx/lau/2002/07/0455.html

    Another consequence: I presented NoteEdit at some exhibitions.
    The audience was always enthusiastic and exciting. But, nobody knew
    NoteEdit: "Ok, but this is a commercial product, because Linux
    has only Rosegarden.", was the first impression.
    "No", I answered, "it is even part of the SuSE Linux
    distribution!". Big surprise! I had the greatest difficulties to
    explain it is GPL. It was necessary to prepare a plate stating:
    "This software is GPL."

  ----------------------------------------------

Q: Do you really refuse any support ?

A: Assume the following situation:

       - SuSE wants to release SuSE-Linux 12 (or so )
       - KDE4 is the current KDE version
       - NoteEdit is un-compilable on KDE4
       - the LilyPond changes syntax such, that the NoteEdit LilyPond
         output is wrong
       - The SuSE packers phone me and ask for a KDE4/LilyPond-x.y.z
         compatible NoteEdit

    Because it is relatively easy for me I'd release the appropiate
    NoteEdit version. I'd honor the fact that SuSE places emphasis on
    NoteEdit in a very early stage.
