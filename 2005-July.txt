Are there any problems why we don't release it now? I would *really*
like to make some improvements and I already made some patches pending
for 2.8.1, but would probably make NoteEdit a bit unstable so I don't
want to apply them on 2.8.0.

I also don't see an obstacle. We just need to bug and hug Reinhard to do
it. I think, soon he'll have time.

Hi Reinhard & Georg & others!

I really wouldn't like to rush or push to anyone in the team, but I
moved and reorganized our SVN myself now to match the common practice
found in most projects I've seen so far and the ordinary structure
that's in the SVN manual mentioned. This way, we can easily test and
release 2.8.0 when it's done and meanwhile, we can develop the 2.9.x
branch simultaniously and port any common patches to both branches. I
hope no one here is losing his temper and going to throw me out of the
development team because of what I made:).

Our repository at svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/noteedit now looks like
this:
/branches/stable-2.8/     (the maintained stable 2.8.x branch)
/homepage/         (our SVN for the homepage. Currently no branches
made for it yet, but will be made later when or if we're going to make
a _completely_ new homepage)
/tags/2.8.0/       (not yet created - Reinhard is going to make this
one when we make 2.8.0 public. This copy shouldn't be touched at all)
/trunk/            (the latest unstable version)

So if you want to update to the latest stable version, you should move
to your current noteedit root dir and use (for the ssh+svn interface)
$ svn switch
svn+ssh://YOUR_NAME at svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/noteedit/branches/stable-2.8
$ svn update

and if you want to switch to the current unstable trunk, you should type
$ svn switch
svn+ssh://YOUR_NAME at svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/noteedit/trunk
$ svn update

in your current noteedit root dir.

If you prefer the "from scratch" variant, you can delete the whole
local repository and checkout by running for example
$ svn co
svn+ssh://YOUR_NAME at svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/noteedit/branches/stable-2.8
noteedit_stable

or

$ svn co
svn+ssh://YOUR_NAME at svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/noteedit/trunk
noteedit_unstable

for the unstable variant. Please tell me what you think!


Regards.

Hello Matev?,

There seems to be a curse on me not allowing to spend a minute of
time to NoteEdit in the last few days :-(
Over the weekend I had to work on the Messias (Haendel) project
and this week I have to continue practicing on this and for the
concert at the following weekend. Also I had lot's of work at
my firm (getting at home quite late), got a new counter-system
for the heating and so on.

Concerning the branch: Great work as always from your side!

Well for me I just did a simple svn update on my stable directory
and I got as result a branches and a trunk and some other directories,
so the above is useful if you're only interested in a part of NoteEdit
and not the complete svn tree. I guess everyone can now the part he
wants to work on.

Concering the release: I don't have the time to do it this evening.
I have to go early to bed and still do quite some house hold work.

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

I understand you perfectly! Take all the time and I wish you the best
at the concert! NoteEdit can wait. There's gonna be an update every
few days or so from my side though:) (btw. I commited the MusicXML
import/export for arbitrary text yesterday, might be interesting).

And don't forget on your best half:)!

Hi List!

I'm just trying to install NoteEdit on my Gentoo System.

I did all the configurations:

export KDEDIR=/usr/kde/3.4/
export QTDIR=/usr/qt/3/


Then started configure as follows:

./configure --prefix=/usr/kde/3.4/ --with-libtse3 --with-libtse3-include=/usr/include/tse3/ --with-libtse3-libs=/usr/lib/


But this fails with the following error message:

checking libtse3... libs in ; includes in /usr/include

libtse3 not found! Please install!
If you have installed libtse3 in an unusual directory
use "--with-libtse3-include=" and/or "--with-libtse3-libs="

There are options to bypass libtse3! But this causes some
restrictions; see README



Can anybody please give me a hint?

Thanx
Andre

Try linking libtse3.so -> libtse3.0.0.0. It works for me.

Did some more tries with tse3-0.2.5 and tse3-0.3.0.
The installation of tse3-0.2.5 does create the right file names for libs:

-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   1474 Jul 12 13:12 libtse3.la
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root     16 Jul 12 13:12 libtse3.so -> libtse3.so.0.0.0
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root     16 Jul 12 13:12 libtse3.so.0 -> libtse3.so.0.0.0
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 997660 Jul 12 13:12 libtse3.so.0.0.0

And tse3-0.3.0 does not as you can see in the privious mails.
Unfortunately, your hint of linking the library to a file with correct
name does not help. Also tried to rename all files (and running ldconfig
afterwards).

How do your tse3 lib files look? Where are they located?

I use TSE3 0.3.0 from the author's homepage. I configured it with
- --with-alsa --without-arts --without-oss and compiled and installed it
with default options. It installed itself at /usr/local/lib and
/usr/local/include/tse3.

Configure script looks only for libtse3.so or libtse3.a in libs
directory and tse3/TSE3.h in include directory. Default libs
directories are /usr/lib and /usr/local/lib. Default include
directories are /usr/include and /usr/local/include.

Using the latest SVN version of NoteEdit (I just made a fresh
reinstall), with make -f Makefile.cvs; ./configure; make and it works
out of the box for me. Which compiler and distro are you using?

Thanx! It works now!
What was wrong? Simple! Even stupid...
After installing tse3-0.3.0 the configure script of NoteEdit didn't find
the library and I didn't recognice the false library name. So I tried
to fix this by adding the 

--with-libtse3-include=/usr/include/tse3/ --with-libtse3-libs=/usr/lib/

to configure script. Even this failed. Then you gave me the hint about
the false library name. But I (stupid) still tried to call configure with
these extra options...

Simply remove these solved the problem. And now I know that the
include path for tse3 is NOT /usr/include/tse3/ but /usr/include/

I just installed NoteEdit-2.7.4 successfully and will play with it now...


Thank you very much for your assistance!!!


Greetings
Andre

Reinhard,

1) I see you managed to release 2.8.0 these days. I would like to
remind you to make a copy of the released 2.8.0 version into
/tags/2.8.0 in our SVN repository.
2) I played downloaded&compiled&installed Qt4.0. I like it so far, but
wasn't able to make much with NoteEdit yet (configure doesn't find
it?!?). Can you say anything about your plans, when and how are you
going to migrate to Qt4.0? We'd have to update our configure to work
properly (or maybe even rewrite it completely?), remove code in #if
QT_VERSION <300 block, make changes to fit a new Qt API and announce
that NoteEdit 2.9 requires now Qt >= 300.
3) I tried compiling NoteEdit with gcc-4.0, but had no luck. I fixed
the configure script and it works fine. The problem is that it cannot
compile TSE3 headers (MANY syntax errors like the wrong use of
type-def, friend classes, templates etc.!). I contacted Pete and I
hope he'll manage to release a gcc4-compatible version asap. I don't
think Debian is going to accept our program without being gcc4-compatible.


Best regards!

Ok, somewhen when I have time again...

I haven't thought about it and I probably won't start thinking about
it until Noteedit 2.8.1 has been released. Scripting and the printing
dialog are the main features needed by NoteEdit in the near future IMO.
I want to wait for that until my distribution officially includes QT4
in some form (that will probably happen in late autumn, end of october
or so). Basically I would drop Qt 3.x support completely as there is
a QT3.x backward compatibility interface in Qt4 and because the 
differences are to large for maintaining backward compatibility. I
also don't think we will se an unstable release this year except we
some developers having more time than me to work on it.

gcc4.0 is in Cooker for Mandriva and I won't switch to it until the
next version of Mandriva is released (maybe if I have time I'll test
the release candidate for Mandriva somewhen in September/October).
I think all other distribution will switch to gcc4 before Debian
will officially start to use it (i.e. at least in testing).

I hoped to manage more than the homepage update an the release
itself but the Linux Info Tag here in Pforzheim where I'm doing
the Linux audio booth alone took too much preparation time (and
still will be incomplete, so I have to improvise a bit). I will
present NoteEdit there as well though I don't think that we will
get a new developer from that day. Maybe I can spend an hour on NoteEdit
on sunday if there is no work left from saturday. The following
week I'll have to prepare for the next concert, so again only
very few time left.

I'm very satisfied with the work and the plans you do and hope
that end of july I be able start working on NoteEdit again on a
more regular base.

Regards,

Reinhard

Future plans: We are splitting up the NoteEdit development into a stable
and unstable tree. The current development focus will be on the stable
tree adding some interesting new features. The unstable tree will get
a stronger focus after the next stable relese. The plans for this tree
will be hopefully unleashed in the near future :-)

As always: If you have any problems or find bugs, please post them in 
the Bug tracker. or mail them to the developer mailing list.
Known bugs can be found in the Bug tracker as well.

Hi all.

I would like anyone, who makes changes to SVN version of NoteEdit from
now on first make a change *to the trunk version* of NoteEdit and
then, if the patch should go to the stable 2.8 branch as well,
*backport* the patch to the stable branch. This could be done manually
(by editing, copying, applying changes) or eg. for a single commit with:

$ svn merge -r PREV:COMMITTED trunk branches/stable-2.8
$ svn commit

This looks for the differences between the previous and the current
repository version of the left side directory (trunk in this case) and
apply the differnces to the right side (stable-2.8).


Regards.

Hi all,

Matev?, thanks for your educational postings about svn with the new
layout. It's defintely helpful for me, this is still my only project
with svn. I'm glad that the new release is now out, and I'm looking
forward to help improving NoteEdit again.

Reinhard, to you many, many Thanks, too. Last to mention: I like our new
homepage.

Best Regards,
Georg

If you're not familiar with all the cookies SVN brings, I advice you
to read the first four chapters of the official SVN book at:
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/svn-book.html

I used frontends like eSvn and RapidSVN before, when I wasn't familiar
with all the commands mentioned in the book yet. These frontends are
pretty straight-forward and easy to understand.

Hi!

I'm a KDE developer and if it's possible, I'd like to join
into the note edit project.

I'm experienced in KDE, QT programming, as I have been
developing the Krusader project (the twin panel file
manager) for 2 years.

The things I would like to do:

- review the code to get more information about the project
- export pages into OpenOffice.org draw (vector graphically)
  for making much easier to insert the score into OOo documents.
- eliminate limitations at editing the notes

My first and biggest change would be the OOo export.

If you think, that my work would be important, please enable
me to participate in your project's life.

Thanks, bye

    Csaba Karai

That really sounds great! We have recently published in
SVN what we plan to do for the next release and who
will probably do it. Still there are many thing left
to do.

I don't know anything about OO internals, the only visual export
capability I'm aware of is the possibility to integrate the
note sheet into conqueror using KParts.

It would be a nice add-on feature though we currently concentrate
on two different things: Improving printing usability and integrating
a scripting engine into NoteEdit. Most other things (except lilypond
export enhancement for the 2.6 version) are bug fixes.

To be able to add you as a developer I need your unix name
of berlios.

Yes, this is certenly fine especially for the Qt4 migration in the
future we have in mind.

Hm... You're thinking something about a OOo module for editing notes?
I've been thinking about it myself a few months ago and I came to the
conclusion that OOo is actually a publishing software (something more
like LaTeX or LilyPond for notes). I think the nicest and the easiest
way for now would be a cooperation with Lily, something like:
1) export to .ly
2) convert to the latest version of syntax (convert-ly filename.ly)
3) compile the file to .svg vector format (lilypond --svg --no-ps
- --no-pdf --no-png filename.ly)
4) import the .svg to OOo

Now, when you'd double click on the score graphics in OOo, it could
run NoteEdit with the appropriate .not file. The idea is to have both
.svg file for the real graphics and always a .not file for the ability
to edit it. The downside is that you need LilyPond beside NoteEdit and
that there could be slight differences from time to time, because
LilyPond uses a much more sophisticated engine for rendering the score
than NoteEdit.

And some minor feature implementations and updates to the
documentation and examples from my point of view:)

Anyway, welcome aboard!

I uploaded the Splash, Icon and developer's Wiki logo graphics in

I'm unable or don't have time to update the graphics when they're most

Thanks, yes, and I still like the splash!

But where is the wiki gone? I almost don't dare to tell that I can't
reach it. I read in my browser:

    Welcome to NoteEdit's public Wiki site! Currently, NoteEdit Wiki is
still empty

I must have missed something. I'm logged in, no English wiki?

Georg

We don't have a wiki on the Berlios page anymore (there was a Wiki for
developers month ago, but we decided to move the it to
http://193.95.242.3/NoteEditWiki on my ADSL server). The Wiki is
non-public and is meant for the developers only. I made an account for
you as well and I urge you to login asap and change your password
(itsgeorg:itsgeorg), if not already. Berlios Wiki will include
end-user information like tutorials, success stories, guides, the most
recent FAQ etc., but isn't yet done.

Yes, I checked the homepage of LilyPond. The result of that program is 
beautiful.  
 
I think that this function worths a new menu item. 
Exporting to png, or pdf with LilyPond also worths it. 
 
I would have never thought that the export works such easily.

You are absolutely right. It would be very attractive if we could edit the 
embedded scores from OOo. 
 
The different rendering engines are not so problematic. A preview window 
could solve it. Printing and editing are often separated in note editors. 
 
Well, this program interests me more and more when I get deeper and 
deeper... This project has future.

Thank you for the answer. Yes, printing is really the most important 
thing to do. To tell the truth, printing and exporting into OOo should 
use the same code.

The OpenOffice.org 2.0 Draw file format is a zip file containing XML files.

These XML files contain lines, texts, bitmaps,...
It's similar to the windows metafile (WMF).

All I have to do is to create a new Paint Engine, which collects the
drawing shapes from QPainter and stores it in odg (The OpenOffice 2.0
Draw format). It's easier, than I expected.

Drawbacks of my solution:
- QPaintEngine is defined in QT 4.0, which requires at least KDE 4
- The odg file format requires at least OpenOffice 2.0

I don't suggest to keep the compatibility with KDE 3.x, and OOo 1.x, as 
it makes the solution much harder. Conditional compilation can be used, 
till everybody will use at least KDE 4.x.

If it is possible, it would be nice if noteedit could print a page into 
a bitmap, or png or anything else... That can also be inserted into OOo 1.x.

I think you should read more about the LilyPond project (or other free
engraving software like ABC music). The project is mature, it's very
complex and it has history (Lily was known as Gnutella a long time
ago). Engraving and notation were in past very respectful jobs.
LilyPond project studied the note engraving science and they tend to
make an engraving engine that offers a unique look of the score as it
would have been made by hand. LilyPond with its syntax is today the
de-facto standard for music publishing as LaTeX is for publishing the
technical literature and Docbook for application documentation.

If we are to make OOo compatibility/plugin, I don't think we should
make a new engraving engine from scratch by ourselves. I would rather
automate the NoteEdit<->OOo via LilyPond process as possible.

Also, our plan for 2.8.1 is to remake and automate the printing
procedures. In short, we're going to automate the export to Lily/ABC,
compilation of the exported file to pdf and calling a printing/viewing
application for that document. In the future, LilyPond for example is
taking some interesting new frontends (eg. Guile and LilyPad), which
render the written syntax on-the-fly. They even allow you to grab
certain elements and move them around freely, to fine-tune the look of
the score. So in the even farther future when these projects get
mature, NoteEdit is probably going to call them upon the current score.

Note that these are my thoughts and visions only. I don't want you to
lose any interest in your goal. I just don't want you to rush and
double the work that has already been done up there.

Keep in mind that this way you won't get vector graphics out of it for
note heads, clefs and other non-linear objects (look at
noteedit/resources for the source images). Using an external engraver
will produce any vector file you want. Also, OOo is written in GTK as
far as I know. Or not?

Our plan is not to sustain compatibility with KDE at all in the
future. We are to migrate to Qt4-only. This way, we'll break the KDE
dependency (easier to maintain Qt4 only) and achieve better
portability. As for OOo, I think the 2.0 is going to become a standard
soon and 1.1.5 will support odg file format as well afaik.

I told before I was thinking about this idea a few months ago. I
thought that OOo can do the texts, sheets, presentations, drawings and
databases. What it lacks is a 3D modeller and a music score editor.
Now LilyPond offers a tool called lily-book which works hand-to-hand
with LaTeX. You actually write the whole book in TeX and only place
blocks of code in Lily syntax where you wish a musical example to take
place. When compiling the book then, LaTeX automatically calls
LilyPond for compilation of the music elements where the Lily syntax
block is found. For myself, that seemed to be too complex (not
everyone is familiar with LaTeX?!?) and I was thinking about an easier
way to write a document in eg. OOo and then to include some musical
examples produced by LilyPond (but not by hand like exporting an
example to .ly, importing the produced png/svg file and then update it
every time when something changes etc.).

I'm wondering, why do you wish to implement an OpenOffice.org
in?eroperability with NoteEdit?

Excuse me. The order of my two mails were changed. 
When I wrote that mail, I didn't read your LilyPond related suggestion.

Anyway, let's postpone this OpenOffice issue. 
I should learn a lot about your code, before writing my first line into the 
code. It may take some time. I didn't think, that noteedit is longer than 
60000 lines...

So instead of developing, I'll play with it, and collect the necessary 
information.

Hi, I just subscribed to this list, so my apologies if this issue has already 
been discussed.

I've successfully built and been running noteedit with gcc4, so I propose the 
attached patch to allow gcc4.

Hi! I've some questions... 
 
1. What is the main reason that the user cannot edit the bar lines  
   directly? 
 
   I've found a short key '|', but it doesn't really work. Buggy. 
 
   I have scores which has no specific time signature, it changes from  
   bar to bar. 
 
   As bar lines can be deleted, but one cannot create new one, this  
   makes hard to correct it. 
 
2. Does NoteEdit support software MIDI sequencers, such as timidity? 
 
   I've installed linux onto 7-8 different computers, but the  
   hardware MIDI sequencer only worked on 2 of them. 
 
   Was it my fault, or just ALSA doesn't support most of the MIDI 
   sequencers? 
 
   If I start timidity as a background process, it works, but most 
   of the users has no idea how to do it... 
 
3. If I use 'keyboard mode' and press ENTER, nothing happens. 
   The documentation says that a note should be inserted... 
 
4. The page settings for export are not saved in the .not file.

The last time I checked, I wasn't able to compile TSE3 headers
(neither 0.2.7 nor 0.3.0) with gcc4 (but it worked ok with gcc 3.4). I
got syntax errors like wrong usage of type-defs and friend classes
etc. (obviously some syntax changes in gcc4). Did it work for you?

For placing a barline, the TAB key is used. For repeat barlines, one
of the three kinds in the toolbar has to be selected and then placed
in the score. For the final barline, an option from menu has to be
chosen. For setting a N-time repeat, you first have to place a repeat
bar and then Edit->Set N-time repeat.

Using a pipe (|) key is IMO not needed anymore and will be removed in
future. About the non-metrum music, I commited a patch that doesn't do
automatic placement of barlines and similar if no metrum is defined.
It should work properly as I tested.

I myself run Timidity in background (I have a cheap integrated VIA
sound chipset on my laptop). Under Debian, all I had to do is to
install timidity and commented out ENABLE=1 line in
/etc/init.d/timidity so it starts as a server on startup every time I
turn the computer on. I think there's not much NoteEdit can do here.
It could run the timidity server when NoteEdit starts automatically,
but it couldn't run it in realtime high-priority mode as it's not run
by root (the startup script is).

Hm... it works for me. I simply activate the Insert from Keyboard mode
(a big A letter on a button on the blue backroung without a glue) and
then I use up/down arrows for selecting the pitch and ENTER to place
the actual note.

True. That's one thing that needs to be included in the new NoteEdit
file format. The problem at the moment is that NoteEdit actually
cannot store any special values than most of the current ones as the
.not file is MUP-compatible and doesn't offer all the features
NoteEdit does.

Yes, it's OK, but it has some drawbacks. If timidity runs, you cannot 
listen to music as it holds that resource.  
 
The best would be to start timidity before playing and stop after the play 
finished. 
 
You mentioned that you are planning noteedit scriptable.  
This start / stop scripts would be nice.

Now it works for me also. I cannot reproduce, if I managed to, I'll  
write more.

Good point. I couldn't get tse3 to compile with gcc 4 either, so I installed 
tse3 using gcc 3.4. But once tse3 is installed, noteedit compiles fine with 
gcc 4. 

I should probably mention that I use gentoo linux, and that my tse3 
installation contains whatever patches gentoo uses.

Another problem it occured to me is, that I cannot compile the KDE
3.3.2 headers (latest in Debian unstable) with gcc4 (again the wrong
usage of type-def before the class name), if building without TSE3.
KDE 3.4.1 is currently in experimental Debian distro though, but I
wouldn't mess with it.

There's a wierd bug that locks a keyboard on the menu from time to
time (no keys got recognized and you can only move through the menus
using left/right arrow keys). You have to go to Settings->Configure
shortcuts and close the dialog. Then the keyboard works fine again.

I've got (almost all of) KDE 3.4.1 installed and compiled from scratch with 
gcc 4. But again I've used whatever patches gentoo provides, plus manually 
added some myself. Anyway, this shouldn't affect which compilers noteedit 
accept, should it? You're not required to have neither tse3 nor kde compiled 
with the same compiler as long as they're binary compatible?

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Transpose bug and it's fix
Message-ID: <freemail.20050628173735.86228@fm4.freemail.hu>

Reproducing the bug: 
 
1. treble(violin) clef + F major key sig (1 b) + B 
2. transpose the score up by 1: B -> "natural" B 
3. transpose the score down by 1: "natural" B -> A# 
     
    so transposing "natural" B down by 1 semitone 
    results A# instead of B 
 
The cause of the bug: 
 
voice.cpp, NVoice::transpose ignores totally the actual key signature. 
 
The fix attached. If you have some time, can you please check if my solution 
is correct? 
 
Thanks in advance, 
 
    Csaba

That's not true at all. Just run jack, and use jack server as timidity
sound output.

I don't recommand this way. Using jack is much simpler and superior to 
your "solution" to the problem. Also you can use other programs for
timidity as well. Also there is one "real" alternative to timidity:
fluidsynth, though you might want to have 1 Gig RAM for it using the
Fluid R3 sound font. Also you could use an organ simulator like aleolus
or a synthesizer like ZynAddSubFX for sound output. (frontends for
jack and fluidsynth: qjackctl and qsynth).

I had once problem with keyboard input making noteedit using 100% CPU
when you press a key. I only found out that is must have something todo
tse3, but haven't investigate further at that time. Now I don't have
any problems at all anymore. All in all it's a bit suspicious.

It looks ok. Actually it justs searches if Key signature is present
and if it is, call the midi2line with an additional parameter - the
key signature. I'm testing the result at the moment. Do you have SVN
write access or should I apply the patch for you?

I don't really know whether I have SVN write access. 
 
Currently I am at the office, behind a firewall. If berlios doesn't 
support access through HTTP proxy, it won't work. 
 
I have a notebook and with GSM modem I can access to the internet.  
Unfortunately, I lent the notebook, so currently I have no internet 
access, only through HTTP proxy.

Ok, I commited the patch for you. Commited version 286.

Otherwise, your user/pass for SVN is the same as the one at Berlios.

Thank you for committing the patch. The biggest problem is 
that this doesn't solve the transpose problem. 
 
NClef::midi2Line is buggy 
 
I've tried to correct midi2Line, but I wasn't succeeded. 
A method is missing from NKeySig, which gives back whether 
the specific line has b,# mark or not. 
 
Excuse me to tell this, but the code of NKeySig is terrible with lots of bugs. 
Rewrite is necessary.  
 
It brokes totally the object oriented technique. 
 
- methods with names that tells nothing 
- methods which logically belongs to totally different objects 
- no comments at all 
- functions, local variables that does nothing 
 
If nobody has objection, I would rewrite that code gradually, 
trying to understand what the author originally meant. 
 
The rewrite may cause new bugs, but if it become much more 
understandable, the development later can be much more faster... 
 
In which development phase are you in? 
- developing, or bug hunting (code freeze),... 
 
Do you have a CHANGELOG in which changes could be logged? 
 
Thanks, 
 
    Csaba

Well I had never problems accessing Berlios. You should have had
SVN access already yesterday and now you have all the accesses
like a normal developer (so you can work on the bug tracker and
the different managers).

I think that is a one of the darks parts in NoteEdit history
I really don't know anything about...

That really sound good to me! Myself I mainly work on the
user interface avoiding touching the interior as far as
as possible ;-)

We have two trees: A stable and a unstable tree. Currently
we are doing all changes in both trees, i.e. we concentrate
on bugfixing and still adding some useful features. We have
planned to do major changed in late autumn.

> Do you have a CHANGELOG in which changes could be logged? 
>  

Currently SVN and the berlios project page is our Changelog.
But all changes we do are written into the NEWS file (one
line for a bugfix or an enhancement).

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Compiling on OSX, FAQ
Message-ID: <20050729065114.52314.qmail@web30610.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I've been trying to get noteedit 2.8.0 to compile on
OSX, using gcc4 but --without-libs (I don't think TSE3
has been ported to OSX). I managed to do this somehow
with an older version of noteedit (2.7.3 or .4) some
time ago, but I can't remember how.

The problem I'm having is that configure can't find
qt-mt >=3.0, even though it is installed at
/sw/lib/libqt-mt.3.3.3.dylib (fink installs everything
under /sw), with symlinks libqt-mt.3.3.dylib,
libqt-mt.3.dylib, and libqt-mt.dylib. I have tried
setting environment variables and configure options,
but nothing seems to work; I've included a couple more
details at the end of this email.

I noticed that the FAQ says that I might get that
error if Qt has been compiled with a different gcc
version than what is installed. I don't think I have
upgraded gcc since I installed KDE (fink compiles
packages from source), and like I said I managed to
compile and run and older version of noteedit. Short
of recompiling, is there a way to find out what
version of gcc Qt was compiled with? Any other insight
into this problem would be greatly appreciated.

I also noticed that the website is asking for a HTML
version of the FAQ, so I made one; see the attached
file.

Cheers,

Sam Hernandez

This is how I'm running configure:

export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="/sw/lib/"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/sw/lib/"

./configure     --prefix=/sw/                      \
                --with-qt-includes=/sw/include/qt/ \
                --with-extra-libs=/sw/lib/         \
                --with-extra-includes=/sw/include/ \
                --with-qt-dir=/sw/                 \
                --without-libs

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] NoteEdit SVN update
Message-ID: <42EA8EDB.8090707@guest.arnes.si>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I made two tags in /tags directory, 2.8.0 and 2.7.4 respectively.
These directories are now fixed and are not to be changed. They
represent the state of 2.8.0 and 2.7.4 releases.

I also reorganized NEWS and Changelogs in both trunk and stable
branch. Here's what I had in mind:
- - NEWS only describes the new features/bug fixes that impact end-user
(and it describes them in the way that the end-user understands them).
It also contains major announcments (like the new organization, new
dependencies etc.).
- - Changelog is meant for developers only. It describes every new
feature/bugfix and its description, commit number in SVN and so on in
the more precision and technical way.

Changelog should preserve history of changes for *the whole current
major version* (1.x.y, 2.x.y, 3.x.y), whereas the NEWS should contain
only information that inpact *the latest release*. Currently, both
NEWS and Changelog in trunk/ should contain changes to 2.8.0 version
until 2.9.0 is released. Then, they will contain only changes to 2.9.0
and so on. If 2.8.1 will be released before 2.9.0, it should still
contain changes to 2.8.0 as it's the junction where the branches split.

Now, an example of making a new feature or a bugfix first in trunk and
then over time backport it to stable:
1) You make certain changes to source in /trunk branch.
2) You write the changes to Changelog (along with the revision number
you're going to get) and appropriate announcment of the feature in NEWS.
3) Feature is tested and in time, you backport the feature to 2.8.x
branch:
4) You look at the trunk's Changelog or SVN log to get the revision
number, when you commited that feature.
5) You merge the branches by svn -r
<featureRevisionNumber-1>:<featureRevisionNumber> trunk
branches/stable-2.8. This looks for the differences you made from the
previous revision when you implemented the feature to the actual one
for directory trunk and then apply the differences to
branches/stable-2.8 directory.
6) You appropriately edit the stable branch's Changelog (and write the
new revision number that this feature is going to get) and NEWS file.
7) You commit the changes.

If the feature is to be implemented in 2.9.x only, you only need to
stick to the first two steps.

What do you think?

I would like to assign the following behaviours to the scroll wheel:
- - Ordinary scroll wheel - Horizontal scrollbar
- - SHIFT + scroll wheel - Vertical scrollbar
- - CTRL + scroll wheel - Zoom in/out
- - ALT + scroll wheel - Fast pan

I think the current assignment for setting note's pitch is pretty
useless IMO. What do you think?

You haven't considered all the possibilities of wheel devices.
You can buy mice with both vertical and horizontal scrolling and
you can even buy devices with complete free scrolling (like my
own mouse :-). You only need to change the XOrg.conf settings
so that this kind of scrolling works.

So I would at least add:
- Ordinary scroll wheel(s) - Horizontal, Vertical and diagonal scrolling

I've read this in the Wiki too, but I'm faster writing E-Mails ;-)

Hm... ok, but how do you define and use more than one scroll wheel in
Qt? And if it's not present, what next etc.

Somehow I'ld like to keep all the possibilities, and get more. Is

    Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Scroll

also a possibility, at least, when you put it in the hot key table? One
of those could be the modifier for faster, wider.

Hi,

I did a small lilypond export update: Header strings get the chosen

because it works for me again. And more polish to come soon for the main

Message-ID: <42EBA4F0.1010605@guest.arnes.si>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I'm digging through MusicXML import code and I don't understand why
are there different mappings for NoteEdit's voice and the file's voice
numbers. Now, there is this VoiceMapper class that organizes and sorts
things out, but I don't really understand why.

For example, if a second voice starts the melody and the first voice
enters in the third measure, MusicXML import code grabs the first
available voice in NoteEdit and assigns the first voice found in file
(the second one) to it. I think things can get really messy, because
in 3rd measure and on, you have the second voice with stems upwards
and ?he first voice with stems downwards. In the latest commit 298, I
arranged 1:1 NoteEdit and file's voice numbers. But I'm not sure if
that was the smartest thing to do. There are quite a few lines of code
for VoiceMapper. Can anyone help me?

SVN works for me, thanks (managed to checkout with ssh & my username).
Next week I'll go on holiday, after that I'll try commit as well.

Hi!

On my notebook, when I start noteedit, the kernel immediately freezes.
I've checked with TSE3 and LIBKMID, both resulted the same.

Kernel version: SuSE 2.6.11.4

Is there an option not to start the MIDI mapper by default?

Unfortunately the 2.6.x kernels are more instable, than the old Windows
95. At least 3 different hardware caused crash on my computer till now.
The SuSE 9.3 distribution is based on this kernel, so kernel change to
2.4.x would cause a lot of different errors.

Do you know something about these freezes?

Thanks,
    Csaba

Hi,

for me SuSE 9.3 is very stable. On 9.2 I had occasionaly freezes, which
was not connected to NoteEdit, and for which I blamed the ATI issues. Is
it only X that freezes?

Did you compile and install NoteEdit properly, so you don't have a mix
of the original rpm and the self compiled?  You can play midi files with
the tse3 scheduler:

     tse3play -alsa -port <number>:0 <name>.mid

I do the configuration like this:

    ./configure --prefix=/opt/kde3 --libdir=/opt/kde3/lib64
--with-qt-libraries=/usr/lib/qt3/lib64 \
                --disable-final --with-libtse3-libs=/usr/lib64

When the rlimit/realtime issues are solved, very soon I think, there is
now reason to look back to kernel 2.4.

Let us know,
Georg

The first plan I had in mind was to use Alt key modifier for fast scrolling.

I took a peak in different apps for mouse wheel behaviour. Here are
actions for modifiers used with mouse scroll:
OpenOffice.org2: 0-VScroll, CTRL-zoom
Inkscape: 0-VScroll, SHIFT-HScroll, CTRL-zoom
GIMP: 0-VScroll, SHIFT-zoom, CTRL-HScroll
Blender: 0-zoom, SHIFT-VScroll, CTRL-HScroll

There are probably different behaviours for the combination of them as
well, but I didn't test it. IMO, combinations in NoteEdit shouldn't mean
any special behaviours, but only combined actions.
NoteEdit: 0-HScroll, SHIFT-VScroll, CTRL-zoom, ALT-fast HScroll,
ALT+SHIFT-fast VScroll, ALT+CTRL-fast zoom(?), SHIFT+CTRL+ALT=crash;)

It's pretty hot here in Slovenia. It was 35?C over day today. And it's 1
o'clock in the morning and it's still 25?C outside!?!!  Phew... not a
pleasent environment for coding:)

Freezes. I think, that the sequencer is buggy, and that's why
the freeze occurs.

And further down, without a synthesizer, I have:
rud at nb64:~> pmidi -l
 Port     Client name                       Port name
 62:0     Midi Through                      Midi Through Port-0
128:0     KAMix                             qamix
rud at nb64:~>

And with timidity on top of jack, by:

    timidity -iA -Oj -B4,8

I get:

rud at nb64:~> pmidi -l
 Port     Client name                       Port name

130:3     TiMidity                          TiMidity port 3
rud at nb64:~>

and can play a song by pmidi -p 130:0 <name>.mid or with tse3play, as
above. I use tse3 how Suse packaged it.

Maybe this helps to check the base of  your midi setup.

Georg

Thank you for the help. I managed to solve the problem.
I disabled the sequencer of my SiS 7018 card with YaST, and now noteedit
starts properly. The hardware sequencer code is buggy.
