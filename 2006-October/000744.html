&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi there,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have just received a reply to the email below which I sent to the
</I>&gt;<i> NoteEdit list. Takeshi Hamasaki  informed me that I would be better off
</I>&gt;<i> asking questions on this list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is the Canorus code stable enough for me to develop the system described
</I>&gt;<i> below, and is it advanced enough for my requirements: supporting at
</I>&gt;<i> least staff display, note selection and MusicXML import/export.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Canorus is probably not stable enough for your aim - NoteEdit is much
more stable in this regard but integration of new feature could prove to
be much more work than with the new code structure of Canorus.

Canorus has of course staff display and some sort of note selection but
there is still some work to do on the latter part to make it complete.
Mainly
showing perspectives to edit things like key/time signature or copy/paste
actions.

MusicXML import/export has not been implemented by now but the interface
has been done to do it. The CanorusML file format itself can serve as an
example
how to implement a proper import/export modules.
&gt;<i> If the main development push has moved towards Canorus, I would much
</I>&gt;<i> rather develop here, but unfortunately I need this tool relatively quickly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How much, if any of the noteedit code has been reused? I'm thinking:
</I>&gt;<i> would it be worthwhile developing on noteedit, with the view to
</I>&gt;<i> migrating to canorus once the program has matured?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>NoteEdit code up to now is not really used for Canorus. We will use some
of the
code for the import/export things and the one or other part of it
containing some
clever but still understandable algorithms.

OTOH Canorus has already scripting support and we just started on a
plugin engine
including plugin management. The main difference to NoteEdit IMO still
is that Canorus
is largely based on the Model-View pattern concept making it very easy
to add views on the
score model. On the User interface part it's the abandon of KDE3 in
favour of single Qt4
usage. Qt4 has integrated several new features making it easier to go
away from KDE3. Also
we have running versions for Windows, Linux and Mac OS-X.
&gt;&gt;<i> I am considering using noteedit as a visualisation tool for performance    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> analysis. I have a system which performs analyses on an audio 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> performance in the context of the musical score, and I need a tool which 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will allow me to display the analysis information beside the score. I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have done some work with Rosegarden in this area, but too much musical 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information is lost through it's midi-centric representation of pitch 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (it is first and foremost, a midi sequencer after all). I assume being 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> primarily a notation editor noteedit would be more sympathetic to my needs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The two layout alternatives I imagine are:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Modifying the horizontal layout to make the note positions on the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> staff coincide with their positions in the analysis panel.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Make the analysis panel scroll to, and highlight the relevant 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information when the note(s) are selected on the staff.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The latter option would probably be preferable, allowing the analysis 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> panel to be zoomed without making the score illegible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I had a quick look at the code last night, and it seemed like it might 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not be too big a job (relatively speaking) to create a working 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prototype. However, there are a couple of questions I couldn't answer 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> last night:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How exactly is pitch stored eg. Class, Octave &amp; Accidental, or staff 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> line &amp; accidental?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>Concerning NoteEdit code: No idea, Matevz can probably help you
on that questions.

Concerning Canorus: Currently the pitch is stored as midi pitch. There
are already some basic plans for microtonal extensions regarding the
pitches.
The class is CAPlayable. Matevz the author of the Canorus model can
explain it
to you more detailled. The Canorus wiki contains a class diagram showing you
the basic design of the model
(<A HREF="http://canorus.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Technical_ideas">http://canorus.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Technical_ideas</A>)
but you should be aware that the picture is a bit out of date now.
&gt;&gt;<i> Some of my work involves microtonal music. How easily do you think this 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be included into noteedit? I have no need for midi support for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> microtonal music, merely that it be displayed and stored correctly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>So far I have collected some microtonal concepts, like setting of
accidentals for
the tighter pitches (thanks to Hans-Peter Beer for a User Interface idea
on editing
these accidentals). We also had some discussion on I think the NE user
ML. As this
feature doesn't enjoy a high priority on my list I haven't created a
Wiki page for it
up to now (also my spare time was quite small unfortunately).
&gt;&gt;<i> How is TSE integrated? It seems that a TSE document is created from the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> noteedit content for playback, is this correct? Ie - if I wanted to make 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> adjustments I do so within noteedit, not TSE.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I welcome any  comments or advice anyone might have on this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>Again I can't tell you only a &quot;probably yes&quot;, as I don't know much about
the NoteEdit
internals. Canorus uses a different midi library for playback. As midi
isn't really suitable
for microtonal features we probably have to look for alternatives or
rely on some midi
hacks (that was discussed over a year ago on the Linux Audio development
mailing list).
I'd prefer to use OSC being quite well supported in the Linux audio
community. OM-Synth
is a very good example for such a program (and could be used as an
interface to other
programs too with jack).

I guess a Canorus plugin would be a good base for your analysis tool.

Best,

Reinhard
