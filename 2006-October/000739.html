Hi all,

I am considering using noteedit as a visualisation tool for performance 
analysis. I have a system which performs analyses on an audio 
performance in the context of the musical score, and I need a tool which 
will allow me to display the analysis information beside the score. I 
have done some work with Rosegarden in this area, but too much musical 
information is lost through it's midi-centric representation of pitch 
(it is first and foremost, a midi sequencer after all). I assume being 
primarily a notation editor noteedit would be more sympathetic to my needs.

The two layout alternatives I imagine are:

1. Modifying the horizontal layout to make the note positions on the 
staff coincide with their positions in the analysis panel.

2. Make the analysis panel scroll to, and highlight the relevant 
information when the note(s) are selected on the staff.

The latter option would probably be preferable, allowing the analysis 
panel to be zoomed without making the score illegible.


I had a quick look at the code last night, and it seemed like it might 
not be too big a job (relatively speaking) to create a working 
prototype. However, there are a couple of questions I couldn't answer 
last night:

How exactly is pitch stored eg. Class, Octave &amp; Accidental, or staff 
line &amp; accidental?

Some of my work involves microtonal music. How easily do you think this 
could be included into noteedit? I have no need for midi support for 
microtonal music, merely that it be displayed and stored correctly.

How is TSE integrated? It seems that a TSE document is created from the 
noteedit content for playback, is this correct? Ie - if I wanted to make 
adjustments I do so within noteedit, not TSE.

I welcome any  comments or advice anyone might have on this.


Cheers,
Dougie
