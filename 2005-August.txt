Subject: [Noteedit-devel] New keyboard shortcuts
Message-ID: <42ED5D7B.7090304@guest.arnes.si>

Greetings to all!

I changed some default most commonly used keys in order to reunite the
UI with other apps as close as possible and make them more logically
placed. The following changes are:
End -> E: Edit mode
Alt-Right, Alt-Left -> Home, End: Move at the beginning of the document,
move at the end of document
Insert -> SHIFT+Return: Insert rest
CTRL+Backspace -> CTRL+Delete: Delete a note in chord
E -> SHIFT+E: Pitch E (a simple E key is now used for Edit mode and
Shift+E is the best suitable option for this IMO)

I also added a new ESC key, which immediately leaves the current mode
you're in. In the future, the second hit should unselect the current
selection as well and go to A voice.

Tell me what you think!


Regards.

(Main difference to the qt3 wheel event are supported extra mouse
buttons), with delta and orientation that should be no problem. Also we
could later combine with left mouse button or so to make it real
complicated to use ;-). Diagonal movements are probably sent as several
horizontal and vertical movements.

That said you don't have to care which wheel was pressed and how but
only on the Qt flags. Everything else is up to the user how he has
assigned the wheel buttons to certain wheel events in his xorg.conf

Hi Csabe,

I had success with Midi all the time with the
following kernel versions on Mandrake/Mandriva:
2.6.8.1, 2.6.11, 2.6.12 (and also with the
alsa cvs snapshort I downloaded on 30. Juli).

You have to load the following midi modules:
snd-seq
snd-seq-virmidi
snd-seq-dummy ports=3
snd-seq-instr
snd-seq-midi
snd-seq-midi-emul

You should remove all midi modules (like snd-rawmidi)
activating your sound card midi hardware which might
be to root source for the freeze. I could imagine that
there are similar sound card types, one supporting
midi and the other one not. Also you should try the
latest stable alsa driver.

realtime issues only concern the audio output (using
jack) but not Midi itself.

Regards,

Reinhard

I guess I was not completely wrong with my supposements ;-)
Can you try the latest alsa driver as well ? Maybe you find
some hints on the alsa mailing lists (archive) as well concerning
your sound card. I also have a SiS soundcard but I guess it's
a different chipset. At least I never tried to activate the
hardware sequencer (if the card sis7012 has one).

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Placing notes on hidden rests?
Message-ID: <42EE6A5A.9010106@guest.arnes.si>

I was thinking about the new feature - if you place a note on exactly
the hidden rest, the note shouldn't be inserted like now, but the hidden
rest should be replaced with the new note. If the length of the note is
smaller, a new hidden rest should be placed after it, so the whole
length should still satisfy the original hidden rest's length.

What do you think? Is it a useful feature?

But still, we need the ALT modifier key for fast-scrolling and CTRL for
zoom. And I also think that SHIFT modifier key for vertical movement
should be implemented as most of ordinary users don't and won't have 2D
mice (eg. laptops).

My question was, should I go right ahead and implement them?

Hi Matev?,

Yes, maybe you misunderstood me, but may suggestion was
thought as an add-on to your list. Of course the users
need to have a possibility for both vertical and
horizontal scrolling even if they don't have an the
option to use two wheels.

Also it might be a good idea to change the behaviour
of the wheels if the user wishes it to using one
of the configuratiion dialogs. I'd suggested the
keyboard dialog (and thus rename it to something like
mouse and keyboard configuration).

Regards,

Reinhard

I've been thinking about hitting up/down cursor key in selection mode to
cycle through notes at the same MIDI time in the current voice (or
through all the voices and staffs when in A mode). Hitting up/down
cursor in the edit mode would change their pitch. More details are at
our developer's wiki.

What do you think?

Please examine the code at Revision 272 or prior, because later, I

You can update to 272 by:

Message-ID: <200508081020.15366.leon.vinken@hetnet.nl>

Hi Matev?,

the reason for having the voice mapper is to be able to easily assign the 
minimum number of voices necessary. As you probably know, a MusicXML part may 
contain more than one staff (typical example: piano music, two staves). The 
voice numbers are, however, unique for the part, not for the staff. This 
means that for a piano part with two voices in both treble and bass staff, 
the voices will be numbered 1 up through 4 (1 and 2 on the treble staff, 3 
and 4 on the bass staff).

The voicemapper implementation makes it easy to assign only two voices to both 
NoteEdit staves created. This is the behaviour as it is in the 2.8.0 release, 
which I would consider correct. Your implementation correctly assigns two 
voices to the treble staff, but (incorrectly, IMHO) assigns four voices to 
the bass staff. Two of the four voices are completely empty.

Normally stem direction should not be an issue on importing, as well-behaving 
MusicXML implementations should write explicit stem directions. Importing 
MusicXML files without explicit stem direction should be the exception, not 
the rule.

Summarizing, I think the removal of the voicemapper usage and the 1:1 NE and 
MusicXML voice assignment is not a good idea. It doesn't solve any real 
problem but creates unnecessary empty voices. Please revert to the original 
impementation.

In case of further questions don't hesitate to contact me, either on 
noteedit-devel or via private email (address is in the source files).

Best regards, Leon.

Hi! 

I've committed some changes related to NKeySig.

The code was not really changed, only some bugs and code duplications
were removed, commented the methods in the header, and changed some
method names for cleaner understandability.

Some words about NKeySig:
===========================

This class handles the key signatures and temporary key signatures.

Key signatures: the flat / sharp accents, placed after the bar line.
It can be regular (0, 1#, ... 6#, 1b, ... 6b), and non regular.

Temporary key signatures: Modifiers (natural, sharp, flat) are valid
until the next bar line. The bar line terminates these modifiers. These
modifiers are the temporary key signatures.

For the correct operation, this class requires the proper clef. The clef
is not always set correctly in the current code, and that cause bugs.

Methods:                Old name:     Description:
====================================================

General:

- constr., destr.
- change()                           // it's like a copy constructor
- clone()                            //  - same -
- isEqual()                          // like the == operator
- toString()            printKeys()  // converts to ASCII
- getType ()                         // T_KEYSIG

- setClef()                          // sets the belonging clef

Thanks for the reply!

Ok, I see now. I didn't know MusicXML format has unique numbers from the
first to the last staff. I'm reimplementing the code I removed in that
revision at the moment and testing it. I'll commit the changes ASAP.

Meanwhile, I'd like you to visit our private development wiki and go to
http://193.95.242.3/NoteEditWiki/index.php/NoteEdit_-_MusicXML_bugs/wishes .
I made two examples of MusicXML files. The first, more complex one,
describes a DTD error when importing the xml file to Finale. And the
second example describes the lack of tuplet support in NoteEdit's
MusicXML code (<time-modification> block is not recognized by NoteEdit).
What do you think?

Hi Leon!

I'm digging through the changes I made and found out the reason, why I
made the 1:1 voice numbers in the first place. The problem occured, if I
wanted to import a score, where the non-first voice started (and the
first voice had rests (hidden) until it entered). An example is a
baroque fugue, where first the 2nd voice starts, then the 1st and later
the 3rd. Also, many choir examples can be found, where altos first enter
and sopranos after them.

Now, the way NoteEdit imported these kinds of files before, was to
assign a new voice in xml file to the first available new voice in
NoteEdit. This way, 2nd voice became the first one, first voice became
the second one in the above mentioned examples and so on. You can
imagine the mess with stem directions and other voice number related
stuff that happened then.

Now, to combine both funcionalities, I'd suggest the following:
1) import the voice numbers as they were prior to R272 (via voicemapper)
2) add a new function that sorts the voices as they're sorted in xml file.
3) this way voice numbers 4,5,6 in xml file will be imported as voices
1,2,3, no matter which one starts first.

I'm trying to implement this now. Comments and better ideas are always
welcome:-)?


Regards.

Yes, fingerlist.h is created out of fingerlist.h.qt2 or fingerlist.h.qt3
when you run configure. It's not actually needed in SVN. I deleted it,
because local SVN always marked it as modified and wanted to commit it.

I implemented the code, but it's not working. NE usually crashes,
because it can't move first voice to non-first voice and vice versa, as
first voice includes signs as well. So I'm dropping this feature
(pending for the complete rewrite of musElement list internals, not
dependent on the first voice only?). I reverted the voice changes as
they were before R292. However, a new function void moveVoice(uint
srcNr, uint tgtNr); is present in NStaff class, which moves the voice
numbered with srcNr before the voice numbered with tgtNr. It might
become useful in the future, especially for voice management as well.

Sounds OK to me. But be careful, as in NoteEdit the first voice is special: 
all "special" elements should go into the first voice. All other voices can 
only contain notes and rests.

Looks good. All three issues describe bugs and/or missing features, e.g. 
layout support has been on my todo list for some time, but I never managed to 
start working on it. Day-time jobs have a nasty tendency to use up a lot of 
your time.

It might be useful to transfer these to the "normal" bug and feature request 
database.

I would like to try to fix the Finale import bug, but don't have Finale 
available mysel, so I need to compare the generated XML with the DTD'd by 
hand.

Regards, Leon.

Hi,

again a small lily export update:

-- A \paper block instead of \layout makes the composer string nicely
right aligned with the music.
-- The property string Last Author is exported as arranger.

I also committed a small patch to Lily code today in R325, just to let
you know. Taken out from Changelog:
- LilyPond export filter successfully tested with version 2.6.3 and
2.4.5 (\version updated)
- Ritardando and Accellerando now printed in italic and below the staff
by default
- Arbitrary text is not printed in bold anymore, because it's too
aggressive. It's only \large and it's for the whole text (not just the
first word).
- noteedit -> NoteEdit in header
- if Lily26 is found, utf8 encoding is set by default

Hi Matev?,

it's been long ago your question, and only now I find a relaxed moment
to think about it and offer my thought on it:

To overwrite and leave the not used time intact is a good feature.
Somehow it's an overwrite mode. And because I'm spoilt, because I have a
simple midi keyboard (and I know some piano playing) which I prefer to
input notes in NoteEdit, I think of two overwrite modes beeing attractive:

1) overwrite mode, which takes the notes and the timing from the new input
2) overwrite mode, which leaves the rhythmic structure unchanged, but
takes the notes/notes pitches from the new input

Often I find it hard work to specify the rhythm again and again. I would
in the new place put a copy with the rhythm I usualy did already, then
overwrite quickly with the midi keyboard, and will be done.
I'll try to be more on the wiki pages. Overwrite mode 1) will allow to
have an empty partiur with mostly only rests, and to fill it up with
music whereever you like.

Best Regards,
Georg

Hi Karai!

I think myself and the entire development team appreciate all the
efforts you made the last bunch of commits about reorganizing NoteEdit's
internals. My thoughts are the same - NoteEdit needs much reorganization
of the current code, so there will be space for tons of new major
features and enhancements we have in mind. I was thinking many times
about the base code and a way to improve some organization stuff (along
with configure/make). But unfortunately, I'm not so skilled and self
confident to actually do the reorganization stuff. But I'm trying to
beat that:).

Btw. Can you prefer any advanced C++ programming and project management
books or resources (which covers something like NoteEdit and other
GNU-based projects). I really think I should read more about the things
how they should be done in common practice - I get the feeling just too
many times that I improvize or "heat the already warm water" (or how
it's said in English:)).

I see you made a new entry in our development Wiki. I read it through
today and I'm quite impressed. The changes and new strcuture reminds me
on the Qt library on times, but I think it's, as I said before, probably
more a standard for Object oriented programming (the new casting methods).

If you have time, maybe you could visit the private development forum at
Berlios and give a word or two about yourself. Anyway, keep up the good
work!


Best wishes!

I can only second your thoughts! Myself I didn't look very deep into
the internals as the program is quite large and complex. But reading
the ML and trying to figure out some code places already showed me
that there is room for enhancement (especially comments).

If I had more time I would try to create some overview documentation
over the code so that it is easier for new developers to get their/our
ideas implemented. That what I had in my mind since NoteEdit was
moved to Berlios. Up to now I only created a doxygen documentation
with several picture. There is one very large picture showing all

Well I had many recommendation for Design with the book "Effectice C++".
This one covers the basic program design matters, and an second one
"More Effective C++" the more advanced themes. Also the STL (Standard
Templace Library) is covered in an extra book. General design books
concerning software projects should be based on UML-2. I have two
books, but they are both in german (basics and advanced topics).
Maybe UML-2-Toolkit is a book for you if you want to learn more
about software analysis and design. The UML-Bible on the contrary
is a book covering everything about UML, for those who want to get
an UML expert. I want to buy a new book less covering UML itself but
concentrating on the software design process. Maybe the book
"Object-Oriented Analysis and Design : Understanding System Development 
with UML 2.0" helps you if you want to take a similar approach.
And finally you might be interested in Interface design books...

Yes I agree, also the Qt book by the Qt authors is really worth a read.

Thanks for the kind words. I was a bit afraid, that my work will cause 
lots of troubles, because of the very big changes.

Some words about my plan:

The music elements should be placed into a linked list, which have
'next' and 'prev' methods and inherits from QObject. This would be the
base of the new architecture. 

If an element requires the clef for example, just walks through the
'prev' methods, till finds it. 

If a new Clef is inserted, clefChanged(NClef *) signal will be emitted
for all affected items in the linked list (the clefs are cached).

With an architecture like that, quite high code separation could be
reached.

The current architecture is very very far from it. That's why I wrote,
that it requires half year or more to finish.

Bye,

    Csaba

That's exactly the problem I had in mind too!

It would resolve much troubles, like better export filters (every voice
could have special elements - bars, clefs etc. in .ly file) and you
should have the ability to place barlines in non-1st voice (which is a
clumsy problem for myself). Actually, we'd achieved that 1st voice isn't
the main alpha and omega one, but is equal to any other like it should
be from the first place. Also, copying from any voice to any voice and
other voice operations would become possible.

Message-ID: <430441DD.4070307@guest.arnes.si>

LilyPond team yesterday released a new development 2.7.5 version, which
brought a new major feature IMO - text scripts (along with lyrics) now
detect vertical&horizontal collision with other music elements (slurs,
noteheads, other markings). Also, if the sillable in lyrics is to wide
and doesn't fit, the space between notes is extended, to fit.

I just thought I might tell you that as I usually had many problems with
fine-tuning text markings in Lily document, but now it's all
automatically. I don't need to use #padding anymore!:)

My reorganizing steps are very easy.


I try to remove as many methods from NMusElement as possible by
moving them into other classes where they logically belongs (the context
helps a lot). 

After making it, I'll reach the base class. A small class in which every
method is understandable. The other classes can be built onto this class
gradually.

The heart of a code is placed in the headers. So if the headers are
reorganized, the code will also be reorganized.

Awful implementation is not as big error as awful headers.
Implementation can be changed any time without much pain.

Telling the truth, in the Krusader project I made code reorganizing.
I changed only the headers, and the implementation followed it. Big
work, but worths the effort.

   Csaba

Good evening!

I managed to gain the NMusElement base class.
The class is committed into the SVN.

NMusElement:
============

Responsible for storing and printing the music elements.

Element variables:

actual_       - a flag whether the element is the actual (drawn in red)
pixmapHeight_ - the height of the element's pixmap
pixmapWidth_  - the width of the element's pixmap
bbox_         - the outliner rectangle on the screen
staff_props_  - staff properties
main_props_   - main properties
xpos_         - X position on the screen (width0+width1+...)
sequNr_       - a sequence number (how many elements are before this)
midiTime_     - ???

Methods:

constructor, destructor

change:                        - at changing the element, sets NMusEdit
                                 properties
clone:                         - clones the element
getType:                       - gives the type of the element 
                                 (T_CLEF,T_CHORD,...)
getSubType:                    - gives the sub type of the element
draw:                          - draws out the element
calculateDimensionsAndPixmaps: - creates the pixmaps and calculates its 
                                 height/width
setStaffProps:                 - sets the staff properties
setMainProps:                  - sets the main properties
getMidiLength:                 - gives the midi length of the element
getBbox:                       - gives the outliner rectangle
intersects:                    - check a point whether it is in the rect
intersects_horizontally:       - ???
setActual:                     - sets the element actual/nonactual (red)
reposit:                       - sets the sequence numbers / X position
getXposDecorated:              - ???
getXpos:                       - gives the X position of the element
getSequNr:                     - gives the sequence number of the element

and the conversion methods:

playable(), chord(), rest(), clef(), keySig(), timeSig(), sign(), text()

Bye,

    Csaba

Hi Matev?,

thanks for this hint. I also ran in this often, so I thought to do a
oneline patch to add " " \raise #0.4 in every text item, so you can
adjust quickly the number in the .ly file, manually. \raise, #padding
and #extra-offset are all similar, and, not perfect. If lilypond would
do it automatically, it would be better. I experimented with 2.7.5, and
it works only when the notes that touch the text have a slur. Without
slur, there's still overlap. \raise and a slur would be compatible.

So, the lilypond developers are aware of the problem, sooner or later
they'll solve it :)

Btw: The paper selection in lilypond export is great! Landscape now
works well, I like it for proof reading. Thanks.

Regards,
Georg.

Yes, but the problem in custom page sizes in Lily code is still there.
Or is it me, who doesn't know how to convience LilyPond to use custom
paper size (and not only the workspace where it engraves as now -
textheight and linewidth didn't work for me since 2.4.x). I'm gonna have
to ask at lily-user mailing list.

Gratulation, this made me also doubt on myself. For me the fixed papers

Hello,
I've subscribed some time ago to the developers list and downloaded the source 
code. I'm wondering about the following:
Where is the software documentation? Doxygen (or something like this) is not 
used to describe the functions or classes. Files have a name and that's it. 
The only comment header is a GNU licence but no explanation what it is doing. 
I have started to work through the code to get an idea how much work it is to 
add basso continuo lines, but it would help to have some more software 
documentation available somewhere.
Is there a bugtracking system in use, releasemanagement document or something 
like that?

Hi Csaba,

basically I agree with you, and I surfed webcsv to look a little bit
what you are doing. I think, even in a big reorganisation, the project
should build and run, maybe have a serious bug here or there not more
than three days.

I did a few checkouts these days. Only yesterday I recognized that
exporting to lilypond gives faulty results, and today it even crashes with

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00002aaaaac73dd6 in NChord::countOfLyricsLines () from
/opt/kde3/lib64/libnoteedit.so.1
(gdb)

Maybe you know easily what's wrong. Nevertheless, today I'll try to
debug this more, before I go to a one week vacation. ABC export is
working well, also XML import/export.

That's it for now,
Regards,
Georg

Hi Taco,

welcome. The bad news is, that there is almost no documentation, just
the sources. So, this can improve.

At least, the bugtracking system on berlios is excellent. It might be
neccessary to get a login there to submit and follow the bugs. The
releasemanagement document is a a4 page of one liners, the News file.
And the updated online help, hopefully translated ...

Anyway, I'm interested how you would like the basso continuo look like?
Is it a seperate stave, more with general bass numbers? These we don't
have yet.

Best Regards,
Georg

Hi Csaba,

basically I agree with you, and I surfed webcsv to look a little bit
what you are doing. I think, even in a big reorganisation, the project
should build and run, maybe have a serious bug here or there not more
than three days.

I did a few checkouts these days. Only yesterday I recognized that
exporting to lilypond gives faulty results, and today it even crashes with

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00002aaaaac73dd6 in NChord::countOfLyricsLines () from
/opt/kde3/lib64/libnoteedit.so.1
(gdb)

Maybe you know easily what's wrong. Nevertheless, today I'll try to
debug this more, before I go to a one week vacation. ABC export is
working well, also XML import/export.

That's it for now,
Regards,
Georg

To tell the truth, the reorganizing steps changed the majority of the code. I don't think, that I made serious bugs, but I cannot grant it. Changing the internals is a painful thing.
 
Unfortunately the reorganization is not yet finished. Similar steps should be done for increasing the understandability.

I know that it's nearly impossible to develop, when the internals are always changing, and because of that, I WON'T DO MORE REORGANIZING STEPS for some time.

Excuse me for the temporary instability, I caused in the code. I gladly help in stabilizing the code again.

Before making the next similar reorganizing steps, I'll ask permission on the mailing list. The instability cannot be avoided after making such a big changes.

Excuse me again for the inconveniencies,

Best regards,

Basso continuo is what everyone used until approx. 1750 to play a bass on 
organ, harpsichord, theorbo, cello etc. etc. For example Bach wrote for all 
cantates a continuo line and not a written out harpsichord part in 2 keys 
like all modern editions. It looks like a single bass line with numbers below 
it. One expected from the player (especially before Bach, like all French 
baroque, Monteverdi, etc. etc.) that he or she knew what kind of chord and 
scale one had to play, so very often even the numbers are missing. A continuo 
part is very free and more like a jazz tune: one has to improvise to make it 
nice. The numbers indicate what kind of chord to play on the note, a little 
bit like guitar chords. So, it's a combination of numbers: 6, 7, #, B (moll) 
etc. sometimes more difficult like 6\n4# 7\n4\n3 (2 resp 3 numbers with or 
without # below eachother).
So I presume it should be put in a separate stave or in a lyric way or this 
guitar extension way. Don't know yet.

I'll first have a look into the code and perhaps I can help with getting a few 
things on paper how everythings works together with some doxygen tags as a 
start.

Hi Csaba!

I'm sure Georg didn't want to offend you in any way about that Lily
export bug. Hey, that's the reason why we have SVN for development, that
we can roll-back to the last-known stable version. And after all,
reorganizing the code is PITA and unstability is expected from all of
us. I'm glad there's no crashes when writing the score in the main view
or even crashes at startup!

I hope we didn't scare you away and that the bottom sentence written in
capitals just means, that currently, you won't have much time to code,
but you'll get back to it as soon as you're able to, and not anything else.


Best regards.

Hi Taco!

The easiest way to implement general bass markings (or basso continuo
markings) would be IMO, to simply take the lyrics code and refit it to
basso continuo markings (you actually only need numbers, accidentals,
line, everything in columns). The downside unforunately is, that if
you'd want to assign multi non-harmonic elements (held, apoggiatura,
rearrangement, anticipation) to a single note, you won't have the length
control over markings.

I think, this could be changed in the future, when the new Context-based
structure of the score (similar to LilyPond) is introduced to NE. So the
class Context would actually be the parent class of staff, lyrics,
tablature, dynamics, basso continuo/function markings and others. You
should be also available to set the correspondence between them then
(and ability to take the others contexts' properties (rhythm in this
case), define these areas and so on).

hi,
this afternoon I wanted to start with this basso continuo extension I 
mentioned a few days ago and started with digging into mainframewidget.cpp 
and opening several files into Qt. Perhaps somebody can give me an answer to 
the following: Why is there no Qt project file? Any reason for this or is the 
2.8.0 tarball incomplete? I would expect that menu settings etc. are easily 
changed from the qt developer environment, as with slots and signals.  It's 
crashing by the way; 2.7.4 is fine.

Hi Taco.

Some windows are already built with Qt designer (eg. Export file dialog,
Staff properties dialog and some other, smaller dialogs). However, the
main window is unfortunately not the case - the whole form is built in
the mainframe constructor.

About the crash, can you send a crash report (compile the project in
debugging mode and send the name of the function, where it crashes). If
it crashes when splash->show() method is called, try installing NoteEdit
by "make install".

You should also try to grab the latest SVN version of NoteEdit IMO, if
you're planning to do any changes on the code.

Well the reason is simple: It's no Qt project. NoteEdit was
in history a Qt-only project and inbetween both KDE and Qt could
be used. Currently it requires KDE though. KDE has it's own way
to create menus in a way not compatible with the designer. I don't
know but maybe it's possible to edit the menu graphically with
kdevelop.

2.8.0 does not crash for me. There are some possibilities
that could lead to a crash: Newer gcc compiler in combination
with an older unpatched tse3 library. Also some midi kernel
modules need to be loaded or (I did not test this personally)
maybe it's enough to start NoteEdit without tse3.

I don't like graphical development environments and am satisfied with vim, but 
was wondering for the reason of partly using Qt but it's clear now. Still a 
pity that it;s kde-only because it limits portability, but anyway, kde has 
future and few people -if any- want to support a windows version.

Hi,

I've added some pages to the NoteEdit wiki's concerning
my ideas for changing export options, adding printing and
print preview as well as the additional settings needed for
doing so. I'm a bit unsure about the export (not the dialog
itself but the separation of printable and non-printable
export formats).

http://193.95.242.3/NoteEditWiki/index.php/RFE_-_New_printing_possibilities

Comments are welcome (and can be added to the Wiki
as well).
