<PRE>Hi Leon, hi all,

I feel I could easily get mixed up with the input modes we have in 
noteedit. To avoid that let me please try to clarify: We have three 
distinct modes:
e) edit mode, E icon is on
s) select mode, arrow icon is on, or at least no note value on
i) insert mode, a note value icon is on

In mode e things are working okay, you come to this mode only later when 
correcting.

Mode s is for navigation, to choose where to start insertions, is 
usefull at the beginning of input.

Mode i is for hopefully fast input of music. In this mode I sit with the 
left hand at the computer keyboard to preselect the time value, slur and 
punktuation, and the right hand hits then the midi keyboard or left 
mouse button for the note :-)  In this mode I enjoy the new working 
triplet insertion! Leon, this differs from your description of triplet 
handling.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The current behaviour for the similar actions make/break beam, slur 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and triplet is:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> beam handling:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make: mark block, press beam button
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> break: select any of the beamed notes, depress beam button
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, a way to break a beam is to insert any note or rest inside 
</I>&gt;<i> an already made beam as well. That's a bigger problem I think. Making 
</I>&gt;<i> beams should should stay the way it is now. But breaking should be 
</I>&gt;<i> only available the way you wrote above, but not by inserting notes as 
</I>&gt;<i> well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> slur handling:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make: mark block, press triplet button
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> break: select the first slurred note, depress slur button
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Making a slur is ok. Breaking it is a bit wierd though. I think it's 
</I>&gt;<i> nonsense to necesserily select the first note and then undo the slur. 
</I>&gt;<i> You should be anywhere in the current slur and should be able to 
</I>&gt;<i> delete the slur by simply pressing the slur button. Anyway, slurs are 
</I>&gt;<i> never nested, so my option is the most feasible IMO.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> triplet handling:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make: mark block, press triplet button
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> break: select any of the triplet notes, depress triplet button
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Making triplets is cool. Breaking them is fine as well IMO. If you 
</I>&gt;<i> insert a note into an already made triplet, the triplet breaks, which 
</I>&gt;<i> is correct IMO.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&quot;mark block&quot; is something I don't want to do in the first place. It's 
too slow. I want to insert notes, slurs and beams, and so on, fluently 
without selecting a block. In mode i the left mouse will always make a 
new note, errors are corrected with backspace, so watch it:). With slurs 
that works, which I prefer as the model of completing triplet insertion. 
I only see now, that beams always need mode s or e, which should be 
fixed (I rarely used them). Leon, do you see things also like this, and 
are your thoughts about the inner workings of the code and the 
feasability still valid? At least for me the description should became 
clear.



&gt;&gt;<i> Possible solutions could be:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - 1) don't change anything (keep the behaviour as is in CVS right now)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - 2) break the triplet only when the first note is selected and the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> button is depressed (thus being consistent with slur behaviour and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fixing your problem, same change should then also be made for beams)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - 3) break the tuplet only when the whole group is selected (by 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pressing left mouse button and dragging), which is consistent with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the way you create a triplet
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First of all, slur, triplet and beam buttons (which reflect the 
</I>&gt;<i> current slur/triplet/beam status of the note) should be updated every 
</I>&gt;<i> time you select a note. I think the option 1) is the most feasible for 
</I>&gt;<i> triplets. I think fixing the slur and beam code is more useful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'm afraid different philosophies collide here. I would formulate like 
this :)
In mode e slur, triplet and beam buttons reflect the current state of 
the selected note.
In mode i slur, triplet and beam buttons reflect the current state of 
the next to be inserted note.
In mode s I don't know, maybe like mode e, better don't care.

And slurs seem to work okay for me, beams need fixing in mode i, only 
mode i needs fixing ...

&gt;&gt;<i> I believe the third option is least preferable, as it requires too 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> much use of the mouse. We should probably do either 1) or 2).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>1) is the best choice of the presented ones.

As another topic: Maybe it helps, and I never saw music not following 
this: We could state as restriction: 8-th triplets can only start at the 
beginning of a quarter in an equally quarter-devided bar, and so on.

And this: How can I make a local copy of the repository to take it with 
my notebook and use svn diff offline to follow you better?

Best Regards,
Georg.
