Hi! 
 
Now, it seems, that I'll have some time to continue the cleanup activity. 
Till now, I was quite overloaded at the office.  
 
I would like to do the following changes on sunday: 
 
Playable::status_ and NPlayable::status2_ cleanup: 
 
1. unify the status_ and status2_ into one variable, as they does 
    logically the same thing. 
 
2. setter and getter methods instead of public declaration 
 
     The setter, getter methods are very important for the further 
development, as we could emit a statusChanged(...) signal to inform 
NChord or NRest about the change. 
 
Setter method: 
 
void setStatus( status_type value, int manner = NPlayable::Set ); 
    NPlayable::Add - sets the 1-bits in 'value' to 1 in the status. 
    NPlayable::Del - sets the 1-bits in 'value' to 0 in the status. 
    NPlayable::Set - sets the status variable to 'value'  
    NPlayable::Xor - is a logical XOR with the status value 
 
 
Getter method: 
 
     status_type status( status_type mask = (status_type)(-1) ); 
 
 
PLEASE: 
 
COMMIT EVERY CHANGES YOU MADE INTO THE SVN! 
 
I'll modify the majority of the code again. If you have some code locally 
stored on your computer, the next commit will be very problematic as the 
merge won't be easy. 
 
If the Sunday is too early, I could postpone the modifications. 
 
Bye, 
 
    Csaba

Hi Csaba and others!

Sunday is ok with me. Although I have a few questions/issues I should
ask about your opinion:
1) What do you think about status_type type? Is it implemented ok? I
ask, because I don't know what's the common practice when coming to this
kind of problems. ie. We needed 64bit integer for the most commonly used
status flags, so 1) "unsigned long long" was IMO too long to write in
the code every time and 2) the 64bit integer isn't uniquely declared in
all OSes/compilers (M$VC has __uint64 for this type I think). So I came
up with #define status_type idea. Is it ok? Or is there another better way?
2) The reason why status2 existed from the first place was IMO the upper
limit of 32 bits for status. Pedal markings would exceed that limit, so
a new status2 was introduced. Now that this limit was expanded to
64bits, these two could be simply merged. My question is, what will we
do, if we exceed 64bits for status type - what else will or won't we
store in status? IMO, we should store musElement properties which are
present in status, to separate variables as well. I would propose a
rule, that status should only include the most commonly used - where
speed/bitwise operations are critical. All other properties should only
be stored in separate variable.
3) Current status's flags positions in status are important. I tried to
sort out most of the problems, when I migrated from 32bit to 64bit
integer by using status_type instead of int, but I left some. eg. All
the dotted/ddotted note methods still use status_type <-> plain integer
or even char casting, as the dotted note flag is one of the first bits
of the status, so the methods preserve some memory. I think we should
force all the methods that do anything with status in any case, to use
status_type in the future though (eg. int != uint troubles). However,
what I don't know is again the common practice in this case - is it the
right thing to do (speed/memory consuption/administration).


Regards.

Hi Csiba,

Thanks for the efforts you take into the cleanup.
As I won't be able to start working on the printing
dialog before sunday (and it does not directly concert
your changes) you can go ahead and start modifying the
code (if no other one disagrees).

Isn't it possible to make the status more simple ? I admit I don't
know the current interface but the Add/Del/Set/Xor method confuses
me more than it helps me understanding the interface. I like the
idea to emit statusChanged signal but that's probably cause I'm
used to Qt manner of handling events :-).

Can you elaborate how the setStatus method is used and should be
used in the future ? Maybe I'll have a better interface suggestion
for these methods after that. I usually prefer working with
enums when having to use states. If the state handling is really
so complex that there can be several states once at a time it might
be useful to categorize these states and write an own method
for each state category. I think even though this would mean to
have more methods it would be easier to understand for someone
who does not use the state code very often like me (probably).

Hmm, still thinking about the Chord "states". We have these many "stats"
(I wouldn't call them states but something like property). First I find
the current solution quite horrible to read and to understand. But I 
have no quick solution for the state "problem". 64bit types are not 
really portable, the only one I know is "long long" (see how Qt defines
64bit types). On the other hand I don't know really how deep these
"states" are part of NoteEdit. I would even prefer a state structure
to the current way states are handled, something like

typedef struct NMusStatus
{
   int state_categ1,
   int state_categ2
} NMusStatus_T;

and later we could try to find a better solution for these states
while still keeping the set/get methods with this structure.

After reading your statement I think a structure for storing this
information is the best solution for the problem. So if NoteEdit has
a need (like time-critical operations) for bitwise operations on states
we could keep them as states like now and all other properties could
be stored in another way.

On time critical operations I would tend to be able to change state
operations directly but not on the global state but only local. When
the time critical operation is over the state can be globally updated
with one of the get/set methods. This way we gain more data 
encapsulation while still keeping performance at a high level.
Encapsulation is also important if we ever want to make NoteEdit more
modular.

Rule 20 of Effective C++ says: Avoid data members in the practice.
Also very important for our design: Rule 34: Minimize compilation
dependencies between files. Even better would be if we would be able
avoid having all the same state handling throughout NoteEdit. That
would mean if anyone make a larger change on the State structure
we would have to change a large portion of the NoteEdit code again.

Reinhard

Hi Marcos,

Thanks for your feedback. Can you elaborate a bit about Musix GNU+Linux?
Is this a music distribution ? If yes on what kind of Linux
distribution is it based? If yes is it possible to download
ISOs (or buy them) anywhere in Europe (Germany preferred for me) ?

Can you describe the setup (Kernel version, sound card, sound
system (probably alsa) and modules used ? Also did you have
the tse3 patches (and the latest version) when you compiled
tse3 ?

I think you're reffering to bug #4437 - NoteEdit crashes when playing
and autoscroll. It was fixed in R349 in SVN. Could you try the latest
SVN version and test if the crash still remains?

1. unifying the two status types 
 
Q_UINT64 is a predefined QT type for that reason.  
By the C standards, sizeof( long long ) >= sizeof( long ) 
 
So the long long status variable is not very safe. I think  
using the QT version is safer. 
 
But on the most unix systems  
INT64 and UINT64 are supported. I think, it's <sys/types.h> 
 
2. faster access for the status variables 
 
I think, that this can be solved easily by a simple inline declaration 
 
inline status_type status() { return status_; } 
 
I think, that the most compiler will make the inline optimization... 
 
I think, that the speed is only important for the getter methods. 
The setter method can be slow by emitting the change signal. 
 
3. the status() <-> properties() change is acceptable for me 
 
We cannot add the properties into getSubType() as the length of the note 
is stored in it. The properties name is very informative.

Hi,

from me also a thanks for cleaning up the code. For production I
switched now to our stable branch.

Copying notes will crash in the head revision, easy producable: In a new
file insert a key, timesig and a few notes. Select a few notes and copy
them (middle mouse button) to the end. Then I get:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00002aaaaad39a9a in NVoice::pasteAtPosition (this=0x987810,
    xpos=13365136, clipboard=0x9879a8,
    complete=true, part_in_current_measure=<value optimized out>,
    dest_midi_time=<value optimized out>, countof128th=0x7fffffec22dc)
at muselement.h:77
/home/rud/svn2/noteedit/trunk/noteedit/muselement.h:77:3739:beg:0x2aaaaad39a9a
(gdb)

I post it only as it might be some help, as it might be easier to fix it
immediately, like the lilypond export bug.

A hello to all, especially Csaba this time,
Regards,
Georg

I only unified the status_ and status2_ variables.

The setter / getter methods were not made.

I had the following problems:

- the name 'status_' should be changed to 'property_' as
  status_ was misleading
- for better understandability in each local variable 'status' should
  be changed to 'property'
- the 'status' member of NNote should also be changed to 'property'
- some structure names contain 'status' and this requires also change
- constants beginning with STAT_ should be changed to PROP_

This requires more than a single day to make, and may cause big
instability. More than 1000 lines should be changed.

What would be the best solution?
- don't rename 'status' to 'property',even though 'status' is misleading
- change 'status' to 'property' only in a small part of the code
  which may cause naming incoherency
- make the changes gradually
- postpone and do it later with a cleaner code
- don't make setter / getter methods
...

I think, that this kind of immense changes requires some discussion.

Bye,

    Csaba

Hi Csaba,

without grepping yet I would vote for a change to the new name. As you
mention 1000 lines, I guess you would want to create a script to do this
change. Could we first create, run, test such a script before we do a
svn change? This may give more base for a decision or give us the job
done. What do you think?

Regards,
Georg

Hi Csaba!

My vote gets the complete name changes throughout the code as well. I
would advise you though, to copy the current /trunk branch to the
separate one, eg. /branches/csaba-coderewrite2. This way, if any
show-stopper bugs occur in your work, you won't influence on the trunk
branch. But when your code is mature enough, you can simply merge your
branch with the trunk one. I think there won't be any major changes and
implementations in this and the following month around status and
similar internal structures. However, if any minor features get
implemented, which use status in any way, they can get quickly fixed on
the merge.

A script doing the work is a great idea! As we have several nice
programs (such as sed) doing such a work, it would simplify the
process. We only have to pay attention for Similar names like
statusBar and statusBarTender. First the long words need to be
renamed and after that the short ones. Also I don't dare to judge
if there are other status things inside NoteEdit except those
belonging to the Notes itself.

Reinhard

Hi Csaba,

I hope I'm not too late with my opinion to your status -> property
changes. I was busy with practicing for an opera by Cherubini being
performed in the course of the next three weeks.

Usually I would prefer a gradual change but in this case I think the
"Hauruck" method (doing the big change at once) would be the best
thing in a manner like Matevz suggested. Gradual changed would only
make sense if we could make a large step into better encapsulation
in the same time. But I think such changes will take a much longer
time than the code restructuring you are doing currently.

And thanks for the fix of the bug Georg reported.

Regards,

Reinhard

I didn't start the change yet. 
I've never created any branch on SVN, so I have to look after how to do it.  
 
I won't use scripts as scripts can change undesired lines, and in a such 
complex code, one could make big mistakes. 
 
On a separate branch, renaming will not be too difficult task, but requires 
some time. 
 
Bye, 
 
    Csaba

Hi Marcos,

Thanks for your detailed answer to my questions. I also forwarded
it to the NoteEdit Mailing lists in case other are interested in
the Musix distribution as well.

Concerning the patches for tse3: There are compile fixes for gcc 3.4 and 
amd64 as well as a fix for alsa1.x and sustain. Also NoteEdit 2.8.0 will 
not compile with gcc 4.0 (fixed in the SVN repository of NoteEdit).

To really find out what went wrong with tse3play configuring you would
need to either show us your config.log or check the output from
configure (i.e. what was missing when tse3 was configured).

Concerning the problem that 2.8.0 disappears: This is already fixed in 
the SVN repository in case you did not read the corresponding mail on 
the NoteEdit ML.

Just one question is left: How does Musix compare to Demudi or better
asked wherein do your goals differ from other audio distributions ?

Reinhard

Something like:
$ svn copy svn+ssh://ckarai at svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/noteedit/trunk
svn+ssh://ckarai at svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/noteedit/branches/csaba_coderewrite2

should directly do the trick. You will get a new revision number then
and on the next svn update, local sources will get updated as well.

Whenever you are going to apply your changes to the mainstream trunk,
you should use:
$svn merge -r <the_revision_number,when_your_branch_was_created>:HEAD
svn+ssh://ckarai at svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/noteedit/branches/csaba_coderewrite2
svn+ssh://ckarai at svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/noteedit/trunk

This will make a diff from revision
<the_revision_number,when_your_branch_was_created> to the latest one of
/csaba_coderewrite2, and apply that diff to the /trunk.

And if you want to delete your branch some day (when the merge is
complete), use:
$svn delete
svn+ssh://ckarai at svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/noteedit/branches/csaba_coderewrite2


Regards.

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Concerning print support
Message-ID: <432186E9.3000806@web.de>

Hi,

I looked at both the old print support and the goals I have
with printing myself. As a first step I decided to use the
KDE printing support already integrated into NoteEdit and
only expand it so it shows the selected music system print
options instead of only abcmusic options.

Though there is a preview integrated into this dialog I
decided to keep the direct print preview menu entry as
it is more convenient for the user to use that dialog.
Also I will keep the settings for the print preview as
described on the NoteEdit wiki.

Later if we migrate to Qt4 we need to replace the
print dialog itself as well as several other KDE dialogs.

Status:

- You still have to enable printing with --with-printing
to test the current printing and later the enhanced
printing. As soon as a certain stability is reached I
will try to enable printing by default.
- Nothing in SVN yet (only tested the settings UI shortly)
- Settings UI is finished excepts labels and some layout changes
- menu entries done
- saving settings done
- default settings done
- resources for printing options done
- started expanding print class / methode

ToDo:
- finish print class / methods
- finish Settings UI

Also some other things I noted:
- Options are only saved when the NResource obect is
   destroyed (i.e. apply does not save the settings)
- NResources are unstructered
- direct access to NResource variables

Regards,

Reinhard

Message-ID: <43218BD2.6040403@web.de>

Hi Matevz,

I cannot save my changed article:

http://193.95.242.3/NoteEditWiki/index.php?title=RFE_-_New_printing_possibilities&action=submit

This is the changed article:

== Settings for printing (preview) ==
The following settings have to be added to the settings for printing 
(%s: Filename of the exported file)
# The program used for print preview and possible options (default: gv %s)
# The external typesetting program used for printing (chosen by a Combo Box)
# The invokation of the external typesetting program  (Midi and MusicXML 
can't be printed directly AFAIK)
# If a custom program is used for printing, use the defined export format
# The print program used for printing (default: lpr %s) (this setting is 
not needed for KDE, it might be needed when we migrate to Qt4)
# Save the options shown for every type of external typesetting program ?
default options for every program (to be added)
# ABC: abcm2ps %s
# Lilypond: lilypond %s
# MusiXTeX: musixtex %s ; musixflx %s; musixtex %s (don't know if this 
is still current with the latest musixtex versions)
# PMX: pmx %s (script to execute pmxab and musixtex developed by me)

Any ideas what went wrong ? I don't get any error messages, I only get
at the preview page all of the time. There's no difference pressing
Save or preview for me.

It worked fine here, your article was commited. I think there was a disk
space problem (the disk was 100% full for the user for 2 days). I
cleaned up some temporary stuff from the server, so there's ~1GB free again.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Hi all.

Debian just got NoteEdit version 2.8.0 into their unstable repository.
Hurray, it was about time:).

Gratulations!

On OpenSuse RC1 they're still on 2.7.3, pity. At least they have
lilypond 2.6.2, and I had to load the module snd-seq for the midi system
by hand.

Maybe I'll look in that some more.
Best Regards,
Georg.

Great to hear! My Mandriva distribution was updated end of August.
It includes the gcc4 patch, so it will get widely tested ;-)
Now the only question is shell I spend my time upgrading my distribution
or for developing on NoteEdit ? ;-)

Oh and btw (and completely offtopic): Printing development has
continued (working on the print function itself). But still not
finished, getting closer every day. On Friday I hope to have
some extra hours time to finish it.

Regards

Reinhard

Great.

I'm currently not developing NoteEdit much, but composing a bit (this
time a more romantic piece... I'll see, if it's public-worth :)).
However I'm memorizing tons of bugs (you can't imagine how much
small-medium bugs hunting we still have), so I'll have something to do,
when I come to coding.

About printing, I thought we're just going to implement a shortcut for
"lilypond exported_file.ly --pdf exported_file.pdf" and "kprinter
exported_file.pdf"? I hope you didn't join the Lily-devel team and
developing a frontend;)!

I cannot say much about Lilypond lyrics -> Georg ?
Which version of lilypond did you use for comparison ?

Back to the subect: Actually printing using abcm2ps is the
first print thing I've nearly fully implemented up to now.
The last thing left to do here is to replace %s by the filename
to print.

Reinhard

This patch of Henri Manson is a good one. Everything works still as
before. I no one else is doing it, I could check it in tomorrow night.
It's good to have the lift to a clean qt3.

Hi Csaba, and everybody,

I checked code_cleanup 363, and it seems to work. Had once a KDE-crash
at lilypond export, but this might not be related, because I'm running
on a patched up realtime kernel.
I would merge code_cleanup and only then put Henri's patch on top of
yours, the sooner the better. On revision 363 we get only about a dozen
fails, which should be doable. I can't execute Matevz' merge
instructions in his 05.09.2005 mail, because I can't find out the
revision of the branch, and, if you would like, go ahead with it.

Hopefully this will not interfer with Reinhards printing too much.

Regards,
Georg.

Hi Csaba!

Unfortunately I won't be able to check and test your work until Monday
(We've got 4 day trip to Italy with the choir). The other bad (could
it be worse?) thing that happened to me was, that I didn't have my
portable computer for a week (motherboard and battery went out.), so I
wasn't able to test any progress so far at all... However, when I
return, I'll test it thoroughly and report any anomalies:). 


Regards.
- Matev?

Hi! 
 
We are not in hurry, so we could wait Matev? before merging the changes. 
I also think, that Henri's patch could wait, as this may make the merge 
much difficult.

I think, that "dozen fails" is not too much and can easily be repaired.  
 
 
The original revision number was 353 from which the branch was created. 
The branch creation increased the revision number of each file to 354. 
 
I think that 353 is the correct number.
