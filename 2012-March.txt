- Duplicate env string in lilytest.cpp, so the path won't get truncated
- Added kpdf as preview program
- Use KProcess:AllOutput on export instead of All
- Use Lilyponds PDF output for preview and print
- Use QProcess for preview as KProcess::NotifyOnExit is broken on my system
- Parent parameters for QProcess and KProcess in preview and export

Regards,

Reinhard
