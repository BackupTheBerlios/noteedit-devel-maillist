Subject: [Noteedit-devel] patch: concurrent uptext and downtext in lilypond
	export
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.1.10.1001111612170.25713@dront.rosnix>

Hi!

Yes, I know development have moved on to Canorus, and hope it proceeds 
smoothly. However, if anyone is interested I have a patched a small bug:

Concurrent text sections or dynamics was not exported properly to 
lilypond. For example, if you have both a piano and and forte between two 
notes (perhaps useful when ending a crescendo) only the last "\f" would be 
exported. In the same way, only the last text section would be exported 
(for example, no "Allargando" above and "tutti" below possible).

This patch fixes that (by using a list), and allows any number of 
text/dynamics to be exported. It may be useful also if you, like me, are 
embedding lilypond syntax in the noteedit source (to get many lilypond 
features not directly supported by export) and post-processing the 
exported .ly. (I can send my post-processor if anyone is interested).

regards

Hi Per Eric,

I committed your patch to SVN trunk, R499, thanks. I cannot promise any 
new releases though, so you should use the current SVN version to check 
it out (some other minor fixes and translation updates there as well, 
which were fixed after 2.8.1).


Regards.
-Matev?
