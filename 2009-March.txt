Hi,

The Google t is close to be opened again this year. Mentoring organizations
are accepted starting next week(!). Details on http://code.google.com/soc.

Unfortunately I neither have time this year to mentor nor to apply Canorus as 
mentoring organization. From last year experience you will need several hours
per week alone for that task (and mentoring also takes up some hours per week).

There is still much work to do in Canorus, if we work our todo list alone we
could provide many projects. Last year there were mentoring organizations
fitting with some of the tasks to be done.

I will put my very spare time into Canorus directly. As the LAC 2009 is quite
close now I don't think we are able to do more but mentoring projects/tasks.

Kind regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Hi,

Good news on this topic: Matevz will update our Wiki pages with the old
GSOC 2008 informations as base for an Canorus mentor organization page.
We have basically decided who could do mentor jobs and the students, still
it would be very helpfull if somebody else could help with the mentor
organization work (should really only concern organization of the organization
;-) so the two mentors (available up to now) can concentrate on mentoring.

Of course anybody willing to do mentoring work can do so (in this case though
some programming knowledge would be very helpful).

Thanks and kind regards,

Reinhard
