Subject: [Noteedit-devel] NoteEdit splash
Message-ID: <42741640.3020006@guest.arnes.si>

I've been thinking about making a splash screen for NoteEdit, so here's 
a preview. It contains the images of G. P. da Palestrina (as father of 
renessaince's counterpoint) and J. S. Bach (as father of thirds 
functional harmony). In background, there is my scanned notebook showing 
a harmony homework (with errors) :-). The splash screen should represent 
a strict composition tool offering rich talent and fullness of knowledge 
and tools (red errors in my homework) meant for composing. Tell me what 
you think!

The homepage is in SVN. Just check it out and adapt it. I'll upload
it then to the server. Probably there is a direct access possible
for you as well (via ssh), I only have to check the access
(group) rights.

Hi,

To access the homepage you have to login to your berlios

With staff names I didn't see any problem, and with lyrics I did a
substitute of (") with two ('). With texts I'll do the same, if  that
works out.

I think it's only the combination of two voices and lyrics. Noteedit is
"confused" to which voice to specify the lyrics timing to. Have to think
about it. Without any gui control noteedit should specify the lyrics to
the first voice, probably.

Copying between voices and staffs seems not to be very compatible. I'm
more guessing then speaking from experience.

Personally I'm used to have every singer on a seperate staff and combine
them in lilypond like in the satb example of lilypond. This area is good
for a RFC. In the example you supplied you could go with chords instead
of with voices.

Thanks for spotting this,
Georg.

Yeah, but a standard SATB choir score layout looks like the one I 
supplied (one staff for women, sopranos stems up, altos stems down, the 
other staff for men, tenors stems up, basses stems down). So I think we 
should stick to this kind of placement. That's the whole point of 
polyphony (multiple voices in one staff in this case) feature IMO.

High Matev?,

I like your idea, it will give us a fresh, let's say lively, image.

These associations are very much in the direction I see the usefullness
of noteedit too. I may only state according to my taste:
-- the pictures of the composers are too hidden, covered, don't have
enough contrast, are not recognized
-- there are too man notes, very few notes, with mistakes, should be
enough. A zoom of less then half the notes?
-- the colors are tasteful, very classical. A little more jazzier I
would suggest (but don't know what it is :) )

The muse splash I like very much. Especially the lyra, which also
appears on the small icon in the menu bar and the control line. This
comes to my mind, because the small icon of noteedit I don't like, and
could maybe hold one note, time sig or key of the splash screen?

Your selection of the composers made me even dream more of the features
I would like to see when we did some more bug hunting: Whithout any gui
tweek I would like, when I open a second noteedit window, load a file
my_macro.not. There I have a few staffs named rhythm_x, scale_y, and so on.

When I insert music by the midi keyboard while some part of rhythm_x is
selected, the rhythm of the selected part is (repeatedly) taken for the
timing of the notes I play. This would speed up inserting second voices,
similar patterns, etc. When scale_y is selected, the selection of sharps
and flats are immediately chosen according the taste reflected in this
scale, espescially up/down preferences.

Maybe it's still a little bit far, this level of  noteedit work, but I'm
at least already looking forward to the new release and a nice splash
screen.

Best Regards,
Georg.

Hi Matev?,

your'e right in this. But it's not a complete featured program behavior.
Usually you have little variations in text or music you want to specify
easily without repeating a whole verse. And, most of the vocal music I
deal with has very polyphic music and words in each of the voices. This
can not be set in noteedit with two voices per staff.

I played a little with noteedit: It allows only to attach lyrics to the
first voice. I'll adapt lily export in the next days to that.

Best Regards,
Georg

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Finished Merge Voice Dialog <-> Staff Properties
Message-ID: <4275C224.6030007@web.de>

Hi,

I finished finally the merge of the voice dialog and
the staff properties (using solution 1, i.e. no apply
/ test button available any longer).

The only drawback of the current solution is that
adding / deleting voices cannot be cancelled (this
does not work for the voices dialog as well so no
real change ;-)

I still have to check in into svn (merging work this
evening), so a bit patience is required.

Best regards,

Great!

I was writing some scores yesterday and had to use multi-voices and as 
usual the first option I chose was Format->Staff properties. Oh well, no 
voice creation here I said. Looks like I won't be mistaking in the 
future anymore:).

No, I will already release 2.8.0 due to the changes to the menu 
structure and the merge of the two dialogs. I think this will be a
good start for the stable release cycle and we still can do some more
UI changes. Also I'd start first a 2.8 Beta 1 so if you still want
to make more menu changes go for it, so we can go for a second
beta or rc before we finally release it.

And I like the splash screen now much better and would integrate
it into the 2.8 release.

Ok, so the 2.8.0 is our main goal now. IMO we should take some more time 
for the release then. I'd say a final release in mid-June if that's 
acceptable? (we're making a 2.8.0 stable) I think we should acomplish 
the following stuff till the release:
- there are some critical bugs, but not so complex to resolve (at least 
LilyPond multivoice export (Georg?) and MusicXML polyphony import bug 
(I'll try to fix it), which mess up the score!).
- we have to update all the documentation (NE docbook) and make sure it 
works. This includes updating the homepage as well.
- remove ALL the links in source, debugging, error messages, 
documentation pointing to the Joerg's web site or mail and replace them 
with our team's one.
- some lipstik would be nice - reinvestigate and rewrite any messages, 
option menus and other signs which are wierdly written (the program 
should look nice and tidy as possible, at least no lower/upper case 
randomly placed. I'd also propose that we should name our project 
NoteEdit and not Noteedit or Note edit or Note Edit and stick to the 
name everywhere then. What do you think?).
- contact all the translators to update their work (currently, I only 
keep Slovenian translation up to date, other .po files get more and more 
fuzzily translated)
- new splash, new icon, makefile/svn building methods etc.

I'll try to contact the translators this evening and tell them our 
situation.

Also, I'd prefer as much testing as possible and production work (I'm 
going to write 2 compositions in NoteEdit this month and print them with 
LilyPond, maybe an arrangment for the choir as well). When we got 2.8.0 
released, I'll contact the official Debian maintainer.

Please have a look at the upcoming icon I'm about to post and check the 
dev forum if you have time and tell a thing or two about yourselves:). I 
hope I'm not too intruding... I just wanted to suggest the plan and hear 
your thoughts, although I'm not a project coordinator.

Ok, you can check it out now. Still one minor thing to do on
the menu voice dialog (will do that now) and then I'd release the
beta version.

Hi Matev?,

I'd prefer to have the release ready one week earlier due to the
Linuxtag event occuring on 22. - 25. June.

Great, that would be really good.

Yes, I'll have to make screenshots for the new staff properties and 
several changes concerning how it works now. As for the homepage, there
was already some suggestion for a "NEWS" section including the current
version of NoteEdit. Also the documentation should be included.

I didn't even know they exist :-). Maybe it's better to have some
real context sensitive help in this case, but I don't know how much
we have todo for it. Also I'd like to avoid double work on both
the documentation and the context sensitive help.

That's a good idea, f.e. Georg pointed me to the "Close all" menu point.
It should be just "Close" and replace "Quit". "Close all" should then
be renamed to "Quit". That's much more logical and is quickly done.

Have you looked at my QT-variant of the menus ? I've corrected all the
menus and I would use this naming. Things like "AutoBar" is no proper
english but sounds to me like a variable or function name. It really
should be called "Auto bar".

Agreed.

Great!

Hmm, you just take a lot of work from me :-). As soon as the first beta
is out I'll do some announcements as well.

One thing that might be helpful is to write down what everyone has 
tested and the test results in the form:

Test case         Expected Test result        Comment   Test Ok (Yes/No)

The test case and the test result should be written in a way that
it is easily reproducible and unambiguous.

And the next time we want to test, we just need to do adjustments
to the test document(s). As noteedit is a quite complex application
this should make it easier to get an overview of what has been tested.
If you don't know how to start on that, take the documentation as
a base for tests.

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

It's a real nice splash screen! I vote for it!

In the small icon I don't like the red color. I would make the note
black, and maybe give one corner the touch of the green color of the splash.

Georg.

I'll fix it soon, although it's not so critical. Have to write some
vocal music for a party this week ...

Your suggestions are great. Just go ahead, I'll help.

I'm not lucky with head revision (125), I'm getting this:

How did you manage that ? I checkout Revision 125 of the 
icons/Makefile.am file. I still found it only has 6 lines.
Please remove the file and try again. According to the
error message some characters have to be in your file i
could not even detect in my file using a hex editor.

Yesterday I did a build on the copy of clean noteedit
directory without any problems. I haven't tested installing though.

Hi,

I updated the Version of the corresponding files

Also I restored some changes being lost when
I checked in mainframewidget.cpp last night.

The 2.8.0-b1 builds and installs fine with the
new admin files.

The po files from the doc directory will be
updated soon as well to reflect the new version.

Hi,

I just checked Help -> Report bug again and I really don't like
it. Either we should remove it completely or find at least out
how the E-Mail is placed into this dialog and replace it.

Main reasons why I don't like it:
- Author cannot be selected
- No problem category can be defined.
- Other KDE programs can be selected

Hi,

I've worked on the menus again (both mainframewidget.cpp
and noteedit,ui.rc) and resolved all issues known to me.
Take a look at it, I will do this in the first beta
including a german translation.

Changes:
- Every menu should no be accessible with a single key
   (f.e. alt-i -> Insert, then a single key for the menu item)
- Added some missing "..." to several menu items
- Quit instead of Close All; Close instead of Quit

I think that the NoteEdit homepage and the contact information for our 
team should be placed in several places (maybe even splash?) and that's 
it. Personally, I didn't even spot a "report bug" menu option.

Anyone has any ideas how to contact them or does anyone already know of

I cannot compile it. In noteedit/mainframewidget.cpp around line 320, 
there are some wierdness. I removed the <<<<<<< before and <<<<<<<<

I assume this (MusicXML polyphony) refers to bug #3944. If I can help, please

Leon, I'll dive into a MusicXML multi-voice import bug this week (in 
non-first-voice, a misterious number of rests is inserted every measure, 
so it screws up the whole score) and since you are the original author 
of MusicXML code for NoteEdit, I'd like you to review my patch and if my 
thinkings were correct (I hope it shouldn't be too complicated though).

Ups, I just saw that I had a conflict in exactly that file when
I redid a checkout. Strange, that it only hit me in the release
directory and not in my other one I used as a base for this one.
Also all the .svn directories are now deleted. Still the archive
seems to be a bit too large for me.

I'm on my way uploading a new beta-1 archive. Sorry for the accident.

Very nice, I like them as the others do. Have you also created

This is now in svn. Feel free to use it.

svn head builds for me again, although I get menu strings mix from every
language we have in NE. Probably the english base is shaken up little
bit. Will the next days do some music and during this test the beta

You can download the original .svg files and edit them with Inkscape here:
http://www2.arnes.si/~mjekov/tmp/NoteEdit_splash_icon.tar.bz

I'm not sure about the correct icon and splash size. Both the splash and 
the icon are squares though. The default size is 400x400 for splash and 
128x128 for the icon. Could one of you please implement the splash 
screen and make&change the needed icons.

I'm breaking through the NoteEdit documentation at the moment. I've 
already updated README and created TODO for 2.8.0. I'm currently 
updating FAQ. Does anyone know, can we have utf8 encoded AUTHORS file 
(so we can include the foreign characters?)? I'd say yes (well I hope so 
because I'm a bit shamed that we live in 2005 and still using latin1 and 
discarding non-english languages:)).

Message-ID: <4279584B.5030700@guest.arnes.si>

I'd remove an ugly&loud MusiXTeX warning message for 2.8.0. I think we 
could include a warning dialog when you successfuly exported to 
MusiXTeX, that this is NOT a latex file and you should invoke musixtex 
or pmx explicitely for making a ps/pdf file. I'm updating FAQ right now 
and I'm going to remove the 3 bullets describing how to disable this 
warning. I'm going to replace them with one, describing why doesn't 
latex export.tex work?

I think this kind of interaction with the user doesn't fit right into a 
serious score editor. What do you think?

Yes, that's the same bug. I'd be glad if you're able to fix it in the following days or the next week, so we can test it and mark it as done for 2.8.0. I'm currently a bit busy with the docs, translations, UI and some other tweaks that need attention (not to mention RL:)).

Hi Matev?,

Thanks for visiting the #noteedit channel, but I was already
in bed when you showed up there.

I don't care if you remove the terrible MusiXTeX warning message,
this seems to be a kind of original historical element in NoteEdit.
I agree that a warning message after export should be suffice, but
we don't need a big flashing and music making hint for that problem ;-)
We don't want to freighten the user, do we ?

I've been translating the FAQ.de back into german right now and
didn't understand the following sentence in A 14.:

"NoteEdit uses the so-called ALSA-OSS emulation in when using the OSS 
only sound system (--noalsa parameter)."
Do you mean
"NoteEdit uses the so-called ALSA-OSS emulation when using the OSS
as only sound system (--noalsa parameter)." ?

I also did already some smaller technical improvements to the
gcc / KDE / QT answer but only in german. Also I'll translate
the README into german as it is now referenced in the FAQ.
(I'll use README.de instead of LIESMICH as that will group the
files closer if you look for a README file):

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Hi Matev?,

First of all, I still haven't checked the admin files into SVN
so that is the reason why it might be possible that compiling from
SVN files. This still requires automake 1.4 and autoconf 2.13.
Before actually updating these files I wanted to test if there
are user having problems compiling noteedit with the configure
file I delivered. So far I got one report back showing me that
he had problems compiling under KDE 3.1. The reason might be that
the created configure script from my Mandriva LE 2005 system might
assume that kde 3.2 is installed on the system. I don't know if that
is the case but I hope that I can test this on another older Mandrake
system in the next days.

Well the error seems to me that you don't have compiled the new 
staffPropFrm.cpp file. There can be two reasons for that:
- You have no current Makefile.am (look for the staffPropFrm.cpp file)
- Your Makefile.in or your Makefile wasn't created properly from the 
Makefile.am

I would suggest you to use the admin files I uploaded and try the
SVN version with them.

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Yeah, I'm a bit busy during the day and I have rehersals with the choir 
every evening, so I usually get home around 11 pm ... I'll try to join 
the channel more frequently.

Yeah, but we gotta admit that Joerg had a sense for humour and thrill:).

Yes, it should be "NoteEdit uses the so-called ALSA-OSS emulation when

That's great. These are the kinds of "updates to docs" I had in mind.

Could you give a little more info about what exactly you consider the bug ? 
The bug report is basically a oneliner, without any detail. An example file 
showing the bug would also be useful.

High,

with the new menues, when I add another voice to a stave, I get without
beeing asked a name for the stave "zeile 1" and so forth. This shouldn't
happen, because most of the time I don't want a name for the staff.

Message-ID: <427D439E.8090004@web.de>

Hi,

Matevz and I have fixed the translation and
the score layout (Bug #3959). The current po
files were checked in. I used the tool poedit
which easily shows new und fuzzy changes in the
to be translated po file.

The main reason why the german file was not working
correctly was fuzzyness. Apart from that the score
layout caption has also been corrected and translated.

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Hi Reinhard!

I fixed some capitals in menus and Voice change ... --> Instrument 
change ... and some other minor tweaks. I also make package-messages. So 
you'd better revise your translation again:)

Hi,

I further updated the german files: README.de, FAQ.de and INSTALL.de.
Georg and other german speaking people: Could you please proofread it
in case of grammatical etc. errors. Also it would be good if you
compare it to the original. I made some changes in the german 
translation which should be "backported" to the english files.

Well it's not in the menus but in the staff properties but I still fixed 
it ;-). It is no left blank. Also the translation for it was removed.

That was done as well. I use Spacebar for playback, Insert for insert
rest and end for the edit mode. If someone has a better solution with
less default keys changed feel free to post it.
Also the translation was updated for that as well.

It's well now, thanks. I like that still the selected staff shows up as
preselected.

Problematic for shure is the insert button: It's often needed, for
toggling the edit mode, I wouldn't cancel nor change that.

The space bar is a good choice for playing, although it was in the hot
key list reserved to insert rests, but didn't work. When working with a
midi keyboard, to insert rests with space would still be my first choice.

Inserting rests with the right mouse button is not so cute in the long
run, I think. I would connect context menues to it. Shift left mouse
button would be a good choice for inserting rests, and it's still free.

In any case, that should be kept configurable. Hopefully I didn't
confuse you too much :)

Regards,
Georg.

A very usefull RFE, I think, would be to have middle mouse scroll 5
times faster when holding the shift key. Even when working on a standard
three minute tune, you watch yourself scrolling quite hard. The scroll
bar is there, but not so convenient. The scroll bar is meant for 600 bar
up pieces :)

Just thought to post this when this is the subject ...

Georg.

Could you make an RFE in the features tracker system on Berlios, so it

The splash screen size is fine for me as well as the icon size.
I don't know if it's a problem but most icons I saw were square.
Will see it after the next reboot how it looks on my panel.

I've integrated the splash into main.cpp including some messages.
I can't do a progressbar as well as this is not natively supported
by QSplashScreen. If anyone knows a place with a custom QSplashScreen
(GPLed) widget feel free to integrate it into NoteEdit.

After svn update and compile the app doesn't start up. I get this:

I added the i18n() function around the messages, added triple dots and 
replaced "Finished" with "Done.".
I hope you both agree.

Anyone tried to compile NoteEdit with gcc 4.0? According to the 
documentation, Qt, KDE and NoteEdit should be all compiled with the same 
compiler, but anyway? Zdenko (our Slovakian translator) tried, but had 
no success running configure. I attached his log.

We don't support gcc 4.0.0 as it doesn't compile KDE.

Hi,

I've created a b2 archive which could be the Beta 2 release.
Except testing if everything compiles and installs on my
system I'd like to ask you, if there is something you'd
still want to have in the second beta.

I won't be here tomorrow evening, so it would be good if
you could answer still today (at least say Stop, if it
shouldn't go out tomorrow in the morning :)

Thanks and best regards,

Hello,

things are looking very okay. Ready to release. And it will not be our
last one. There is always headroom for tweaks left ...
Did a little polish in the README's, the FAQ's I checked.

And the red off knob I expect at exit (Beenden), not at close (Schliessen).

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Building NoteEdit on Qt/KDE platforms < 3.2
Message-ID: <4285E801.6060607@web.de>

Hi,

I just checked in a new version of the configure.in.in file
being the base file for the configure. If you are on an older
system, check it out and run "make -f Makefile.cvs" and you should
now be able to compile noteedit on your system as well.

To do this manually edit configure.in.in and change the first line
#MIN_CONFIG

to
#MIN_CONFIG(3.0.0)

Older versions of KDE and QT are no longer supported. If you need
NoteEdit for these platforms you have to stick with the 3.7.4 version.

Future releases than 2.8.0-b2 will contain a configure file for
the Qt/KDE version < 3.2.

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Does this mean, we don't need admin files downloaded from the Berlios 
project page and can use SVN version only to build it?

No, this means someone has to check in the newer admin files into
SVN. After the next release they can be removed.

... and now they are in SVN. So you can now checkout and test
them directly.

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Better splitting of time values
Message-ID: <4288E479.9000002@schwaben.de>

Hi all,

when a note or chord is inserted and there is not enough room left in
the current bar NoteEdit places the rest of it nicely in the next bar
and ties it, as it should be. I made a small patch that makes my life
easier: When the part before bar sign consists itself of a shorter and a
longer value, NoteEdit now flushes the longer part in second place, just
before the bar sign. I think, in all cases this gives a better rhythmic
notation. So no corrections by hand in this case any more. If I oversaw
something, please let it know.

There are issues with auto bar insertion when placing 8 beat notes.
Maybe I'll look at those soon.

Best Regards,
Georg.

Message-ID: <42892B6F.3090501@schwaben.de>

Hello,

I occasionally got an example of a threaded QT example before my eyes.
So I made our splash screen disappear after 3 s. Just with dummy waits
and messages. It works for me (once I had an XLib connect error).

What is strange, during compile I get this message:

    main.cpp: In function `int main(int, char**)':
    main.cpp:107: warning: unused variable `NResource*nr'

When I remove 'NResource *nr' the app doesn't start up, which I don't
understand. What it's that for?
I attached the patch. I would like the automatic switch off of the
splash screen, but enough time to look at it :)

Best Regards,
Georg.

Looking at the code and understanding it is easy (see resource.h).
Everything in this class is static and so you can directly access
all resources through NResource::... method calls or direct member
access. Of course in the real object oriented C++ world this is not
really a good design. But you need once to load all the resources
and hold it in memory. This is done in the main program. To get rid
of the warning I added a (void)nr; line in the next line.

The splash screen patch itself has a bad interface to the main program.
I have added two methods, one showing the splash and another one
changing the message text. After loading the program it stays
on top about 3 seconds using the start method already in the thread
and dissappear afterwards. Get it from SVN.

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Hi Reinhard,

thanks for including. It's always interesting to see other peoples code.
And improving the startup of NoteEdit, for example the size of the
window, is still open for hacking :)

Well no longer, the position & size of the window is now saved 
("WindowPos") to the "Startup" group. Default size is the
available screen geometry. Have fun with this! (I fullfilled a
wish for NoteEdit I had since a longer time but forgot this recently).
Now only toolbar positions and state (visible or not) is open.

Believe it or not, I tried to make this RFE done in the past 14 days, 
but never really got time, but didn't get far. Did you use kapp->config 
to read/write entries? And what about posx,y and width,height. Which 
values from which object did you read (I used NMainFrameWidget and 
NMainWindow, but none of them showed the correct size. I only managed to 
get height_ variable, which is set everytime in resize() procedure). And 
the last question, did you have any issues with KPart code? I got some 
crashes in my version, if local frame size was smaller than 
KPART_WIDTH/KPART_HEIGHT. I never understood how they are related (KPart 
is something for integration with Konqueror, right?)


Regards & thanks again for this feature (btw. did you update NEWS?):)

Stupid. setGeometry and geometry methods are what I was looking for. And 
they work. And writing entry to kapp->config is as simple as showing 
pointer to the geometry rectangle (I thought String was needed for 
config file) ... something I needed at least 30 lines of code for, but I 
see, it should be optimized to 8.

Oh well, sometimes I just feel being to immature for this project, 
especially when it comes to Qt:(.

Well I went already months ago through all the pain with geometry(),
DesktopWiget and friends so I had the solution already in may mind ;-)
The config / qrect combination I found in the kde manual, so I was
quite happy how easy this could be done. Otherwise I'd used 4 config
entries instead of only one. Maybe that's even the better solution
for future NoteEdit versions.

It's only a matter of experience. Three years of coding with Qt
later it will be much easier ;-)

Kparts is a collection of KDE classes. It is KDE's component object 
model, allows an application to embed another within itself. Doesn't
sound that familar ? KParts can also interface with the KIO trader to 
locate available handlers for specific mimetypes or services/protocols.
(Most of this was from the KDE homepage).

I don't know if kparts is only used for embedding NoteEdit into a
webbrowser (I haven't managed to get that run correctly but that's a
different topic) or also for other things.

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Reduce accidentials region selectable
Message-ID: <428D7F03.8090800@schwaben.de>

Hello all,

I attach a patch that allows me to do Extras --> Reduce accidentals
(Vorzeichenzahl minimieren) not only about the whole staff when nothing
is selected, but also about a selected region. This makes things more
consistent, I think. I plan to try the same in raising or lowering the
pitch in a region with those:

    ctrl+mouse wheel
    shift+mouse wheel
    ctrl+schift+mouse wheel

(Should they go into the list of configurable keys?)
My patch is not yet cleaned, not factored out enough. Anyway, have fun,
comment if neccessary,

Best Regards,
Georg

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] keyboard shortcuts question?
Message-ID: <428E5840.5060800@guest.arnes.si>

Does NoteEdit use a standard KDE dialog and menu option for Keyboard 
shortcuts? I think not, because it wasn't named & translated by 
default's KDE dictionary. Also, the icon for keyboard shortcuts menu 
option is not present there.

NoteEdit does use the standard KDE dialog for keyboard shortcuts.
It calls KKeyDialog::configureKeys with the keys defined in keys_
(see mainframewidget.cpp). Can't say anything about the icon.
At least the menu entry is no StdAction of KDE. I don't even know
if there is a StdAction for configureKeys in KDE.

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Removing report_bug failure
Message-ID: <428F4D9F.5070902@web.de>

Hi,

I've found know way to remove the std-menu item
"Report bug".

I tried two ways to get rid of it (the first one is commented):

	// Get report bug action to remove it from the help menu
	//KAction *rbug = 
actionCollection()->action(KStdAction::stdName(KStdAction::ReportBug));
	KAction *rbug = KStdAction::reportBug( this, SLOT(fileSaveAs()), 
actionCollection());
	if( rbug )
	{
	  rbug->unplugAll();
	  //actionCollection()->remove(rbug);
	}
	else
	  printf("Could not remove ReportBug menu\n");

When trying to access the menu using actionCollection() the rbug pointer
is uninitialized. It seems it gets created after the constructor. This
might be the reason why the second method fails as well.

unplugall removes the action from all toolbars and menus according to
the KDE documentation. remove does remove it from the action list.

Any ideas are welcome how to solve the problem.

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Ok, I added the standard configure_keys icon for the Configure keys 
option. I looked at the KSnake and KBabel source and they don't have 
Configure keys items anywhere in Settings menu. So I think the option 
should be available as KDE StdAction.

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Concerning saving toolbar settings
Message-ID: <4294134C.905@web.de>

Hi!

I partially checked code into SVN concerning saving of toolbar
settings. I could not test the code as it crashes for me all
the time when I try to save it when quitting. I tried it on
both quitDialog(2) and closeAllWindows methods from mainFrameWidget:

NMainWindow *mainWindow = NResource::windowList_.first();
NResource::writeToolbarSettings(mainWindow->toolBarIterator());

(first two lines of the method),

The problem seems to be an invalid mainwindow:


ASSERT: "mainWindow()" in ktoolbar.cpp (1876)
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

I haven't any clue why this happens as the mainwindow
is perfectly valid (after my two lines the dialog for
closing the window(s) might pop up.

Reading is done as usual in main.cpp before the main window
is shown

now it compiles, and runs without crash. The load code has to be patched

Hello,

to make this bug list smaller, I fixed #3505, revision 196. It's about
abc export with repeat open at the start of the piece. Usually this is
not necessary, but if you want, you can have it. LilypondExport would
swallow it, btw. Maybe once NoteEdit will be able to start in the middle
of a piece, then repeat open at the beginning will be needed. Of course,
problems should be reported.

Hi,

I fixed the crash bug in SVN (the culprit was how I accessed
the toolbar itself). It's now working with the patched I posted
here. But it doesn't store what I expected; instead it stores
information such as Icon (and Text) or Icon only... so with
my patches "only" Bug #3418 would be fixed.

Hi,

If anyone wants to start reducing some warnings in NoteEdit he can do it
in mainframewidget.cpp:

Replace the keyboard shortcut creation insertItem() and connectItem() by
one single line insert(). The insert method requires an What's this 
string (i.e. a more or less detailed help, more than a simple tool tip).
I've added a patch to this mail not yet in svn so you get an idea how
to it.

Hi!

The trick to get it going was to move the code from the
mainframewidget constructor to the mainwindow constructor
(I didn't notice that the action stuff is done in the main-
framewidget constructor).

Regards,

Reinhard

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] noteedit 2.8.0-beta2 on FreeBSD, still some issues
Message-ID: <200505262250.47415.raphael-langerhorst@gmx.at>

Hi all,

I have first found noteedit in SuSE 8.0 and now I want to start doing 
some note editing on my machine. Meanwhile all my systems run FreeBSD 
so of course I try to install it there (it's not in the ports 
collection - which might change soon...).

Anyway, trying to compile it on FreeBSD has so far produced these 
results.

a) please add -lpthread to the TSE3 tests in configure

b) compiling with gmake gets pretty far but finally stops as the 
alloca.h include file could not be found (what's that for?). I 
couldn't locate it on my system, what is it used for? Can anyone send 
me a copy of it? Is it part of any package (which one?). Logfile 
attached.


Besides: Rosegarden does not run on FreeBSD at all as it is tied to 
the Linux sound system (ALSA). But I do not want all that 
midi/synthesizer(??) or other extra stuff, just a well working note 
editing software - based on KDE if possible.

I think there is not much that prevents noteedit from running on 
FreeBSD, I'm familiar with software development, so I'll do my best 
to get Noteedit working FreeBSD and provide you with some patches and 
probably create a port - so every FreeBSD user can just install it 
right away.

I'm also playing the piano for 15 years now and the violin for ... 
more than 10 years, so I also know lot's about notes in general (some 
theory...)


Best Regards and Thanks a lot for continuing to develop Noteedit

Could you provide a patch? Or somebody else has to jump in, configure is
not my strong field :)

It's part of headers glibc-devel-2.3.4-23 here on my suse. I sent you a
copy just in case per pm.

That's nice to hear. Many people here think that NoteEdit is (and should
improve as) a tool for the composer, not so much for mixing sounds. It's
for people that like to look at notation and to get finally a nice
printout, and, of course, some little midi playback or import is helpful.

Luck for the porting effort,
Regards,
Georg.

ok... if no one is going to do it I'll download the svn version and 
see if I can find the appropriate places to patch (I'm not very 
familiar with the GNU autotools as well, just directly hacked the 
configure script).

Received it, thanks... uhm... to me it just looks like a malloc thing 
with automatic freeing of resources, right?

man alloca on FreeBSD says that the file is included in stdlib.h, and 
I tested by removing alloca.h from the includes and - it compiled!!!

So... I'll fetch the source code from svn and hopefully have a patch 
soon... (or 2)

Yes, exactly. That's what I need as well. It's great that NoteEdit is 
developed along those lines, I already love it :)

Hi,

Somewhere it's documented, somewhere under SVN. But shortly, let's say,
if your personal berlios username (unixname) is 'atberlios', you have to
do those two commands:

    export SVN_SSH="ssh -l atberlios"
    svn checkout svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/noteedit

To work with berlios is great!

Regards,
Georg

ok, it's really wrong as it were on the homepage... now, that's 
probably to your unlucky repository layout (you should put what's 
called "CVS HEAD" in the CVS world into /trunk in the SVN world). 
Since no trunk was created, you have the following URL:

svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/noteedit/

Whereas here on the web (see 
http://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=2232) it says:

svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/noteedit/trunk


I have downloaded it now.

Note that you will have a hard time creating branches if you do not 
use /trunk or something in your repository for your main line of 
development. Branches in Subversion are just a different path, 
like /branches/noteedit-2 or /georg/make-it-cool-branch
whatever :)

... I don't know if you need instructions for subversion or not, but 
in case you do I know a little bit about it. But I don't want to 
sound like I knew everything.

Just in case you need more info, there is the complete subversion 
handbook: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/

Raphael

Any help for that would be appreciated :-). We use configure.in.in
as the basic script and create configure from here. AFAIK pthread
library is part of glibc 2.3.4 so I wonder why the test fails.
OTOH I don't know if it is really needed for tse3 or if tse3 can
be build without it. So I'm a bit reluctant on adding a dependency
for that case.

A copy was send to you by Matevz. alloca.h is part of glibc 2.3.4.
It defines the alloca function.

Currently noteedit is based on KDE. That might change however in the
future. The stable branch (soon 2.8.x) will still be based on KDE for a
quite long time I suppose.

That really sounds great! Here we usually only provide sources for
download and they should theoretically compile and run on every system 
having KDE3, QT3 and TSE3 (see INSTALL), though I only have tested
on Linux based systems.

So what are you doing with NoteEdit ?

I looked into stdlib.h (/usr/include/stdlib.h) and found it included
alloca.h on my system. So I think we should be save when we replace
or remove the alloca check. That said I didn't find any alloca check
in my configure scripts. Strange... Which autotools versions do you
use ?

Great! Don't forget to run make -f Makefile.cvs when you have
checked out from svn.

Yes, I think along those lines as well. Printing will be of course
improved with every new version to come :-)

Also esvn is a nice UI to svn.

Hello :)

Well, FreeBSD does not have glibc, it has its own c library (and 
pthread is probably a separate library).

It's easily possible that one of the used base libraries requires it 
and not TSE3 itself.

It's also part of the FreeBSD libc, .... responding to your second 
mail right away: if alloca.h is included by stdlib.h then it's really 
better to just remove all #include <alloca.h>  (I'll go about this 
tomorrow and send a patch). FreeBSD does not have alloca.h - it's 
directly included in stdlib.h (at least man alloca tells me to 
include stdlib.h)

And the alloca.h issue is NOT a autotools issue, it's purely source 
code related. The other one (adding -lpthread) is autotools related.

What else would you use? Qt only? Or sth completely different (what 
could be better than that?).

Yes, it looks like most of it compiles out-of-the-box, just the few 
quirks you encounter if you never test it here, nothing serious I 
suppose (I don't have a complete build so far).

Editing notes :)   (and really just that, not playing around with a 
full synthesizer, so I'm more tending to the composer approach. 
Still, playing one or the other track with midi output is certainly 
nice to have as well).


And thanks very much for the warm welcome :)

Hi Reinhard!

Now that you removed the Report bug dialog, an additional separator line 
between Tip of the day and About NoteEdit remained. Is that easily 
removable? If not, we shouldn't bother, just to let you know :-).

Yes, this started also to bother me. Maybe I'll look at it. It needs fixing.

As a pill that nowbody has to suffer too much about this: When you
export to lilypond without stem directions lilypond does a nice job in
arranging them automatically.

Yes, Lilypond sets the stem direction automatically, according to the 
voice number (top one up, bottom one down) if \stemNeutral (default) is set.

Message-ID: <200505282241.11195.raphael-langerhorst@gmx.at>

Hi all,

attached patch solves issue a) of my list to make NoteEdit work on 
FreeBSD.

It adds the -lpthread flag to configure.in.in for the TSE3 test.

Please TEST THIS BEFORE APPLYING. I do NOT know if it works on Linux 
with this patch. Please let me know if it worked or not. If it did 
not work, does anyone know how to check for the operating system in 
the configure script?

Hi Matev?,

thanks for setting this up. I read through it some time, and I think
it's a very good input you gave. I'll contemplate a little more before
I'll start to add my thoughts. And I'm just wondering about the url of
the wiki page. By name it seems not to be on our berlios pages, the wiki
link there is empty.

In the meantime I'll try to understand better the NoteEdits internals
and fix hopefully this stem bug ...

Anyway, everybody have a nice start in this summer,
Best Regards,
Georg

I think Wiki is a good place to introduce our development thoughts and 
ideas (although we must have in mind that this Wiki is public) about 
NoteEdit. Implementation of major new features and restructuring of 
NoteEdit should IMO look like this: introduce them on Wiki (and write as 
many info as possible, even some source code examples etc.), polish and 
crystal them up and then arrange them and make a compromise among other 
conflicting (if they are) ideas from other developers and only then, 
start implementing them. This way, we won't be doing double work, if 
someone's already on something like this and we'll all be aware of new 
things going on, how they work and what is (or should be:)) their 
purpose. I think anyone of us should be able to help an ordinary 
NoteEdit user if he has questions or troubles about any part of NoteEdit.

Well, other Wiki topics beside the development ones (ie. Wiki for users) 
are of course also welcomed:). That's just the first thought it came to 
me, how the Wiki could actually be useful at the moment.


Regards.
- Matev?

Message-ID: <200505292258.59806.raphael-langerhorst@gmx.at>

Hi there,

svn revision 205 does not compile (updated a minute ago). See attached 
output. I assume it's some build setup bug, but no exact ideas, the 
output is not quite usable.

I have basically removed all alloca.h includes as well, including the 
patch I've posted yesterday (anyone had a look?). But the compile bug 
is unrelated (I assume) to these changes.

Do you guys run ./configure with any parameters on your distros? Because 
I always have to run ./configure --with-qt-includes=/usr/include/qt3 
when configuring NoteEdit. However, when compiling some other KDE/Qt 
projects (the last one I recall was KGuitar), configure script usually 
finds Qt includes automagically. Or is it just me and my Debian?

Using a clean svn download and rebuild, it compiles and installs fine on 
my Debian unstable on my k7.
gcc 3.3.6
automake 1.9.5
kde 3.3.2
qt 3.3.4

There only one problem with the title: I don't see anything
related to NoteEdit in it. I think it should be moved to
NoteEdit(_)-(_)Brainstorm(_)ideas.

Did you go on the german pages ? The english pages contain a link
to the brainstorming page (Maybe it didn't exist when you read it...)

This seems to be a pthread problem, at least I hope you can solve it

Woops, sorry. I thought we had our own Wiki area as well. I moved as you 
proposed to NoteEdit - Brainstorm ideas.
