Hall?chen,

I downlaoded the sources for Noteedit  2.80. Before I am going to try to 
import it in Visual C++ 6.0 to compile a Windows version,
one question: Has anybody done this before ? (Dann k?nnt ich mir den 
Stress sparen)

Hallo Fred, 
Some time ago, i looked into the sources. And as i remember, it is totally kde 
and QT based. So you will have no chance to compile it in VC++, unless you 
got the non free QT version (the free one is mingw) and build a wrapper 
around the kde functions. 
but maybe this changed B))

Hi,

Currently NoteEdit is based on KDE3. Neither QT4 nor KDE4 will be
supported in the next few months. I don't know anything the
KDE3 port status and it's requirements. I would very much recommand
to use those KDE3 tools (based on cygwin, mingw etc.) if you ever
want to start on a windows port. There is much old code in NoteEdit
which might cause problems with the VC++ compiler (at least for gcc4
one patch or the latest trunk from svn is needed).

Also there are alternatives to run NoteEdit on a Linux server if you
have an extra computer available (Cygwin X-Server or TightVNC).

Regards,

Reinhard

Hi,

For all german Midi/Typesetting enthusiasts:
A new book has recently been released from the
bomots publisher: "Rosegarden kompakt"
(the english version was released in July:
"Rosegarden companion").

I guess we have to do something next year to get a book
"NoteEdit companion" as well :-) (They seem to have
some knowledge about DTP as well ("Scribus kompakt"),
so it would fit)

Hello, my name is Rafael Ponieman and I am an amateur musician and
programmer from Argentina. I've been using Linux for a while now but I
find that I could replace almost every program with an open source
alternative exept sibelius (I used that one on windows, I'm nowadays
using finale under wine and learning NoteEdit). I find NoteEdit  excelent.
I want to start participating in the developement of NoteEdit. I can
help with programming, music related stuff and translating to Spanish.

I asume that I'm automatically subscripted to the mailing list. If not
please tell me. Thanks.

Best regards,

Hi Rafael,

Welcome to the developer Mailing list. It seems you have
succesfully subscribed yourself. I'm one the project
leaders of the NoteEdit project.

Thank you very much for your kind contribution offer. I
need your berlios account name to be able to add you
to the developer crew, else you won't be able to check
in your work into SVN.

We are currently heading to the next release (2.8.1 ?)
and some translation updates are needed. Also I hope
we find some time for documentation improvements. Up
to now we "only" have a german and english documentation.

I suppose Matevz or Georg will tell you some more details what's
going on the development process. We log all changes (bug fixes or
new features / improvement) in the ChangeLog file.

Best Regards,

Reinhard

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Printing automake updates
Message-ID: <43BFF575.5090503@web.de>

Hi,

I fixed some bugs with compiling previewprint
using the automake method. One include file config.h
was missing and the previewprint.cpp was not included in Makefile.am.

If you check out NoteEdit and use scons instead of automake
you currently have to manually touch config.h in the main directory
or else every file including config.h will not build. I have to add
a generic "WITH_SCONS" variable or similar so these includes won't
be used in this case.

Regards,

Reinhard

Hi Reinhard,

Well, I will need some time to get used to the source. and I will thank
if you could gide me. Meanwhile, if you agree, I will start the Spanish
docs.

I'm having some trouble compiling the svn version. The error is the
following:

In file included from configuredialog.cpp:821:
configuredialog.moc: In member function `virtual bool
   ConfigureDialog::qt_invoke(int, QUObject*)':
configuredialog.moc:88: error: `printLayout' undeclared (first use this
   function)
configuredialog.moc:88: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only
   once for each function it appears in.)
make[3]: *** [configuredialog.lo] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/home/dex/src/noteedit/trunk/noteedit'
make[2]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/dex/src/noteedit/trunk/noteedit'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/dex/src/noteedit/trunk'
make: *** [all] Error 2


I suspect it must have something to do with qt-3.3.4-r8 or with kde 3.5.
I've been inspecting the source but I couldn't solve the problem. It
seems as that was a function on earlier versions of QT or on newer and
my QT headers don't have it so it doesn't find it.

Well, I'll keep working on this issue, and if you wish I will start the
spanish docs.
By the way, my berlios name is "rafadev".

Best Regards,
                         Rafael.

Hi Rafael!

As Reinhard said, you should register to Berlios server and send us your
nickname, so we could add you to the development team. There are many
areas NoteEdit should need improvements. A good Spanish translation is a
very good starter IMO! Other documentation, including manual, could see
some improvements as well. Otherwise, I advise you to dig in the source
and start to tweak the program :). If you need any help, let us know.


Regards & welcome aboard!

Hi to all!

I've been really busy for the last 2 months and my hands are still full
of work for the next 3 weeks (school exams...). I hardly wait to dig
into mainframewidget.cpp and voice.cpp again though :). Another thing
that happened to me was that I didn't receive any mailing lists messages
for the last 3 months (bad ISP mail at myplace??), so I made a new
account at gmail and I'm using two accounts in Thunderbird now, one
separated for NoteEdit.

The other thing I wanted to mention was the last bug I was fixing
(phew.. some months ago, my last submit?!). That's a showstopper bug IMO
that NoteEdit doesn't treat right clef & key signatures in non-first
voice through time. An example: The 1st voice holds a whole, the 2nd
voice plays 4 quarters. Now, you place a different clef after the whole.
If you playback, the first quarter is played in the first clef, but the
other three are in the second one already (although the quarters should
wait the whole for the new clef!!). Now I already managed to fix this
behaviour when editing notes (playback when you change pitch, automatic
accidentals placement before notes etc.), but when hitting play button,
the behaviour is still wrong. Something is messed up in playback code
(in NVoice::getNextMidiEvent() I think).

Any ideas? It's my top priority when I get back, but I'd be grateful if
anyone could share any info about it or even solve this mistery. The
MIDI code is still a tabu for me :).


Regards.

Hi Reinhard.

Sorry, I didn't see the last message you sent to the list. I touched
kguitar_excerpt/config.h and the kguitar part was compiled fine with
scons. Another error I got was that lyrics.ui was not found - I had to
manually copy lyrics.ui.qt3 -> lyrics.ui. Now, I got an error that
strstream.h is not found. That is because GCC_MAJ_VERS was probably not
set and it wanted to include obsolete headers that aren't present on my
system anymore. Can you update the scons script so it checks for the gcc
version and set the variables up as well?

No, it's a real bug with how I started with scons project development.
I just used my compiled tree but did not make a make maintainer-clean,
so config.h etc. still was available.

I have started changing SConstruct to use WITH_SCONS and changed
all files to use this define including config.h. Also I removed
some double config.h include (in both header and source file).
The only currently known issue is that lyrics.ui has two versions
(the qt2 version has to be removed somewhen). As soon as I managed
to copy this file platform independently (Copy exists in scons but
I made an error somewhere in the SConscripy) I will check in the
whole stuff.

Regards,

Reinhard

Hi to all too!
Matev?, had to forward this and your next mail by approval. You sent it from your unsubscribed adress.

The last few weeks I used NoteEdit a lot for preparing rehersal tracks for my singers group. The fast scroll feature Alt+mouse wheel I really enjoyed, as it's very usefull. And I was distracted by preparing feedback recordings for my group with ardour and my rme multiface, also messing with low latency kenrels, which was fun for me.

Did some trial of debugging when copying a series of triads to another stuff, no success yet. Will try to dig more in the internals.
So, Regards,
Georg.


And, I'm the right one in http://www.candiesdandies.de <http://www.candiesdandies.de/> :)

No, I won't do that. I simply assume that gcc-3x or higher is used.
I declare gcc2.x as deprecated like kde2 / qt2 is deprecated. At the
moment I simplay have added a -DGCC_MAJ_VERS=3 to the SConstruct but
in the long run these gcc compiler specific things should be completely
removed (we want to have a portable NoteEdit with as less as possible
"special cases" for compiling).

I have checked in new SConstruct, SConsscript (noteedit) and changed
so WITH_SCONS is checked before including config.h. Also I added
VERSION and WITH_FADE_IN options. Next I added copying of lyrics.ui
if it was missing. Finally I added the output of the log file when
lilypond output is missing and removed "--ps" (to show the error that
lilypond up to 2.6.4 does fail when trying to create a pdf file).

Automake fails for me currently, tse3handler symbols are for some
strange reasons not found though they are defined somewhere in the
libnoteedit.o / tse3handler.o

Reinhard

Ok, I updated my copy and I'm compiling at the moment.

If we're going to use qt4, how do scons&qt4 work together? Do we still
need qmake? If so, when would .ui files go to .h and .cpp files then?

I guess, now the whole developer crew has moved to Thunderbird ? :-)
Welcome back, you only have missed about 5 not announced release
announcements. Most important to me is the LAC 2006 in Karlsruhe
(Did you read these mails from the archive?) end of April.

I guess I don't know much more about midi stuff than you do. The only
goal I have somewhen to move to a more platform independent midi
library. I've still not finished printing completely and found a UI
bug (values are not correctly displayed from the resources) if you
configure custom print output (like when you want to start a current
development lilypond from a path not in your $PATH). I guess we will
have some more debug sessions until the 2.8.1 release.

Something for Wiki / IRC ? I have written a comment in the
noteedit/SConscript file (lyrics.ui). I have some more ideas but
currently don't won't to discuss them openly here.

As a side note: The problems seems to occur only with a recent
version of scons. Downgrading to 0.96.1 solved the problem.
I suppose that scons tries to create a noteedit/noteedit
directory and this conflicts with the executable name noteedit.

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Going on hollydays
Message-ID: <43C8F51B.5030202@gmail.com>

Hello,
          I'm writing to tell you that I'm going (actually in ten
minutes) on hollydays to the south of Argentina. I've made my bags and
I've been loading everything in the car.

          I've been getting into NoteEdit lately, but I didn't have much
time. I hope seeing a 2.8.1 version when I arrive (February 15). When I
come back I'll have (or I suppose I'll have) mucho more time so I can
really get into NoteEdit, and I'll have more time to compose and play (I
use the opportunity to mention that I play piano).

Well, good luck to all. I'll write you as soon as I return home.

Best regards,

                        Rafael.

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] hotkey issue
Message-ID: <200601272356.23276.adamsz@gmx.net>

Hi folks,

I had an issue with hotkeys with KDE 3.5. Being not even able to delete notes 
I started investigating this issue and found out that it can be fixed by 
changing a line in mainframewidget.cpp:

keys_ = new KAccel(this);
to
keys_ = new KAccel((QWidget*)this->parent());

Dunno whether this was a KDE bug but with this change the svn version seems to 
work in KDE 3.5 on an x86_64. The configure script should be adapted to find 
libtse3 in /usr/lib64.
Please CC me for answers.

Best Regards,

Adam

Thanks for the hint and for the way to fix the problem. I myself can not
confirm if it works as I don't have KDE 3.5 ( and probably won't have it
until april). Probably we won't make much changes to the configure
scripts as you can still specify the directory where to search for lib
files. We have at least one developer working on a 64bit platform. Maybe
he can share his experiences
Also we're on the way moving the project management from autoconf to scons.

Reinhard Katzmann
