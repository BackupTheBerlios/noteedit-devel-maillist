<PRE>Hi all!

   I am doing some scores* for my father and some of them need the
special ending feature. When I export it to lilypond, it gives an
incorrect second ending. You can see by the attached file. The
lilypond output has the second ending stopping in the first measure,
in spite the first ending is correct. Maybe I am just using Noteedit
in the wrong way, so you can give help me.

   I submited a bug (id 007990) for this, but also tryed to solve it
myself. And I think I did it! :-) I would like to put it here for you
analyse it and see if it doesn't break other parts of the export code.
The exportation treats the end bar and the normal bar in the same
piece of code. This makes the second ending stop just by reaching a
normal bar. So, I changed it to just stop the special ending if it is
really an end bar. I think my changes  will not break any other part,
because they don't change any variables, just the order of execution
in one of the possibilities. My tests show it is working as I want.

  If it is not clear, I am ready to discuss it.

  My best regards.

* In case you wonder why it is in italian, I am descendent of italians
that came to Brazil around 1890 (my last name should be Falchetto, but
the registers here changed to match the portuguese pronounce). They
retained many traditional folk songs, passing them from father to son,
in oral form. And now we are trying to preserve this wonderfull
treasure by making a book, in which the scores are being made with the
help of Noteedit and Lilypond. Noteedit is saving me many hours of
manual typing. I can't say enough: thank you for this great project!!
