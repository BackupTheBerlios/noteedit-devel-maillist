<PRE>&gt;<i> I'm against a lisp scripting language as it is for the normal user much
</I>&gt;<i> more complicated to learn than an object oriented programming language.
</I>&gt;<i> My favourite is ruby. Concerning Lilypond: If a user is able to make 
</I>&gt;<i> changes in his lilypond score that touch the lisp interface of lilypond
</I>&gt;<i> than he has completely different abilities than a normal NoteEdit user
</I>&gt;<i> has. Many of the possible NoteEdit users I know would ever dare to touch
</I>&gt;<i> a script written in a lisp language. 
</I>
Personally I don't know the lisp language. I'm only aware of it through 
LilyPond, so that's why I first took a look on lisp. I'll take a look at 
ruby this evening. Also, what about python or perl languages? Or lua? 
What I have are some short ideas of why the scripts could be used for. 
I'm still searching the net for the right language as we're not going to 
write our own one, right?

&gt;<i> The first step for an advanced API is to actually document the API. The
</I>&gt;<i> base is of course the doxygen documentation and with that I would have
</I>&gt;<i> to find out where the interface between the script and NoteEdit has to
</I>&gt;<i> be drawn. The NoteEdit library is too big as an API for the scripting 
</I>&gt;<i> language itself (actually it contains complete NoteEdit, I ask myself
</I>&gt;<i> why the library is so big). What could be inside the API ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - control of all typesetting elements
</I>&gt;<i> - control of staff / voices
</I>&gt;<i> - editing control
</I>&gt;<i> - file control
</I>&gt;<i> - Midi interface control
</I>&gt;<i> - import/export control
</I>
Some features that just came to my mind that NoteEdit should also 
provide are actions like Selecting the certain chord (which selects all 
the notes in all voices and staffs which are held simultaniously at that 
moment), calculating intervals (the quality (major, minor, perfect, 
diminished, augmented) and quantity (prime, second, third, fourth, fifth 
etc.)) and so on. I think the scripts should have a useful framework so 
they could actually be made useful (for harmonization or whatever already).

&gt;<i> Things like transposition, change clef etc. should be done via scripts
</I>&gt;<i> or macros in the future. Also my idea is to provide many default 
</I>&gt;<i> macros to the user as a base for composition work and for own 
</I>&gt;<i> scripts/macros.
</I>
I agree, these things and probably many others in the future should be 
performed by NoteEdit's system scripts (the same as different engravers 
are made in LilyPond, only the core and cpu most demanding stuff is in 
C++) and not the NoteEdit itself.

&gt;<i> There probably is no real difference between macros and scripts. I would
</I>&gt;<i> call a macro a short script which can be recorded and played back within
</I>&gt;<i> noteedit. This would be another way to create a basic script that can
</I>&gt;<i> later be expanded with your favourite text editor :).
</I>
Yes, a very important feature of a scripting language should be 
inclusion of other scripts. So NoteEdit should offer some basic scripts 
(or macros). You should then only include them and make a more complex 
scenario based on the included scripts.

&gt;<i> Currently I can't really imagine why NoteEdit requires a real plugin
</I>&gt;<i> support. I think scripting / macros support is enough. It still probably
</I>&gt;<i> will be painful enough to expand NoteEdit so that a scripting interface
</I>&gt;<i> can be created.
</I>
That's correct. I didn't have a real idea of differnce bw/ plugin, 
script and macro. If plugins are treated as precompiled modules attached 
to the main app, then no, we don't need plugins. Scripts should satisfy. 
They can also fit nicely into NoteEdit UI (they should be a part of the 
menu and the user wouldn't even know what's behind the UI, a script 
should be ran in a separate thread and a user could stop it, a script 
could report the current progress so the status bar in NoteEdit will get 
updated and so on).
