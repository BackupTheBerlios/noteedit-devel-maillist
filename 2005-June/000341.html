<PRE>Hi,

&gt;&gt;<i> My favourite is ruby. Concerning Lilypond: If a user is able to make 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changes in his lilypond score that touch the lisp interface of lilypond
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than he has completely different abilities than a normal NoteEdit user
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has. Many of the possible NoteEdit users I know would ever dare to touch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a script written in a lisp language. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Personally I don't know the lisp language. I'm only aware of it through 
</I>&gt;<i> LilyPond, so that's why I first took a look on lisp. I'll take a look at 
</I>&gt;<i> ruby this evening. Also, what about python or perl languages? Or lua? 
</I>&gt;<i> What I have are some short ideas of why the scripts could be used for. 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm still searching the net for the right language as we're not going to 
</I>&gt;<i> write our own one, right?
</I>
Ok, I have found a python &lt;-&gt; ruby comparison on the ruby page (FAQ):
<A HREF="http://www.rubygarden.org/faq/entry/show/14">http://www.rubygarden.org/faq/entry/show/14</A>

And a comparison chart:
<A HREF="http://www.approximity.com/ruby/Comparison_rb_st_m_java.html">http://www.approximity.com/ruby/Comparison_rb_st_m_java.html</A>

I cannot recommand perl as it's syntax tends programmers to make
unreadable code. It's of course very powerful and has a lot of
add-on modules (CPan) but it's no pure object-oriented language like 
ruby (python has also procedural elements like Perl). I don't know
LUA but from it's description it's also a procedural language. The
main difference between Python and Ruby seems to be the complexity.
You can also download a ruby book:

The basic question is if we want to have every element of Noteedit
as an object or not. I vote for yes as it is the more natural way
of programming. It also should make the transition from C++ NoteEdit
code to scripting code more easily.

&gt;&gt;<i> The first step for an advanced API is to actually document the API. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> base is of course the doxygen documentation and with that I would have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to find out where the interface between the script and NoteEdit has to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be drawn. The NoteEdit library is too big as an API for the scripting 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> language itself (actually it contains complete NoteEdit, I ask myself
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> why the library is so big). What could be inside the API ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - control of all typesetting elements
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - control of staff / voices
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - editing control
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - file control
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Midi interface control
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - import/export control
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some features that just came to my mind that NoteEdit should also 
</I>&gt;<i> provide are actions like Selecting the certain chord (which selects all 
</I>&gt;<i> the notes in all voices and staffs which are held simultaniously at that 
</I>&gt;<i> moment), calculating intervals (the quality (major, minor, perfect, 
</I>&gt;<i> diminished, augmented) and quantity (prime, second, third, fourth, fifth 
</I>&gt;<i> etc.)) and so on. I think the scripts should have a useful framework so 
</I>&gt;<i> they could actually be made useful (for harmonization or whatever already).
</I>
Selection of whatever (notes, chords, systems, voices, ...) if of course
part of editing control. The rest would probably be simple methods on
one note (concerning interval calculating). Maybe it would help to sort
the API also on objects (note, staffs, voices, files, rests, ...)

&gt;&gt;<i> There probably is no real difference between macros and scripts. I would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> call a macro a short script which can be recorded and played back within
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> noteedit. This would be another way to create a basic script that can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> later be expanded with your favourite text editor :).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, a very important feature of a scripting language should be 
</I>&gt;<i> inclusion of other scripts. So NoteEdit should offer some basic scripts 
</I>&gt;<i> (or macros). You should then only include them and make a more complex 
</I>&gt;<i> scenario based on the included scripts.
</I>
All of the above languages support such an include feature.

Regards,

Reinhard
