<PRE>Hi Matev&#382;,

I'm on IRC now, too and meanwhile playing viola a bit for the
summer concerts (Haendel Messias).

&gt;<i> As we haven't heard in a while, I'd like to bring some update. I tackled 
</I>&gt;<i> with some minor bugs in NoteEdit this week (like &quot;nothing to play&quot; -&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Nothing to play!&quot; and &quot;d flat major; b minor&quot; -&gt; &quot;d flat major; b flat 
</I>&gt;<i> minor&quot; typos and appropriately updating translations). However, I've 
</I>&gt;<i> been quite busy with the exams and I don't doubt you were busy too. 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, how's with LinuxTag?
</I>
I wrote about on an extra Mail. For recapitulation: I will be on the
LinuxTag from Di (afternoon, we're building the Audio booth there
and in the evening we have some lunch) to Saturday afternoon (in
the evening I will have my serenace concert). Meanwhile I was busy
preparing (mainly cleaning up and backuping my laptop, still not
finished with that work.).

I wish you all the best with your exams!

&gt;<i> About development, I think it's high time to release the 2.8.0 and make 
</I>&gt;<i> a 2.9.x branch. I have some harder bugs to fix and some brainstorm ideas 
</I>
Yes, the release can be done anytime soon. I just have priority on
flyer and poster so basically some needs to checkout SVN run my build
scripts on them. Before doing that in all files 2.8.0-rc1 has to be
replaced by 2.8.0.

&gt;<i> and would need the 2.9.x being available asap. Meanwhile, I updated our 
</I>
2.9.x leading to 3.0.x will be in a new branch. It's not really
difficult to do that according to the docs but still I haven't managed
it to do that up to now.

&gt;<i> wiki brainstorm ideas a bit. Please let me know what do you think about 
</I>&gt;<i> the new Dynamic tempo idea. Soon, the exams will end and I might be able 
</I>&gt;<i> to get myself coding! Ideas like implementation of Ruby scripting 
</I>&gt;<i> language, a new API, new keyboard shortcuts and UI, tons of new features 
</I>&gt;<i> introduced on Wiki are waiting in my head to get out:). Ugh, I also hope 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't lose my anxiousness when I start the real coding:).
</I>
Well I'd be happy if I'd finally finished reading the docs but that's
probably needs some more days as well (probably continue on wednesday).
After that I wanted to start a real comparison between QT 4 and the
current gtkmm (including gconfmm as gtkmm has now configuration support 
AFAIK). Concerning coding I mainly will work on 2.8 first as the 
printing dialog will be hopefully in one of the next releases also.

Regards,

Reinhard
