<PRE>I searched the web for occurences of NoteEdit and found many sites 
pointing to the old Joerg's place. I went through all the first page of 
Google's hits and contacted their site administrators to correct the 
links to the new home. I also spotted TSE3 home being not up to date and 
contacted Pete. I think people shouldn't have the feeling that this 
project is dieing out by looking at the old NE's home. Sometimes I feel 
like people don't take this project seriously enough.

Second, I removed the QtCheckBox warning every time NoteEdit is ran, by 
deleting the value Checked with string &quot;true&quot; from mupWarning.ui. I'm 
not sure why this was good in the first place, because checked is 
already a binary value with bool true/false. If anyone knows, please 
correct it back.

Third, I removed the Lily warnings (like \property not found, WITHOUT 
slures, WITH semicolons etc.) from lilytest.cpp. I think they are not 
needed anymore now, because Lily export is tested enough and works fine 
and I also think they are obsolete (some ranging to &lt;2.0 versions of 
lily) and shouldn't be mentioned anymore as convert-ly should convert 
the whatever-version-already-exported to the latest version of Lilypond 
syntax. The only warning I left was the Lilypond version found output 
(returns x.y.z or not found).

Fourth, I added my Ballade no.1 and Fugue no.1 I composed some time ago 
to NoteEdit examples. Anyone knows if the examples are installed to 
/usr/share/noteedit as well? Because currently, looking at /usr/local 
I'm not able to find them anywhere. They're only present in NoteEdit 
source dir.


Best regards!
