<PRE>Cool, I finally commited the working 
remember-stem-direction-in-voice-dialog patch. Please test.

Meanwhile, I'm trying to dig out the ritardando/accellerando MIDI 
playback bug. It was present from every version of NE I remember. It 
goes like this:
When eg. Ritardando sign is present, the notes after the sign sometimes 
get accellerated (instead of slowed down), sometimes even to a few 
miliseconds (so all you hear is a loud bang when MIDI playback comes to 
rit.). However, it's not quite repeatable. In the following example, you 
can try to playback from note to note before the rit. sign and you 
should be able to spot the bug. From what I found out, I can tell that 
if you playback the second time from the same note, the rit. always gets 
played correctly. And if you try to playback from the last note before 
rit. it's always repeatable. And if you move from note to note randomly, 
it sometimes work and sometimes doesn't. I don't know... are your 
findings the same?

I'm not sure if I'll be able to fix this bug till 2.8.0. Maybe it should 
be critical along with some similar trill. bugs (if accidental is 
placed, pitches not always played correctly) and maybe a negative time 
for grace notes solution, I spotted, for 2.8.1?


Regards.
