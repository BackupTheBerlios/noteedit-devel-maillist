<PRE>Hi Matev&#382;,

Agreed. I saw this weakness when I implemented the staff/voice 
properties but as it was already existant I didn't change it as
I don't know much about the NoteEdit internals. (Also undo/redo
improvement is already on our list).

&gt;<i> What I like in staff properties is that the overspace, underspace is

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Here I don't understand what you are trying to explain. Also I can't
say much about staff properties currently as I don't know all 
possibilities NoteEdit has or can have.

&gt;<i> btw. I've been thinking about submitting a Summer of code 
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html</A>) project on NoteEdit. I'd like 
</I>&gt;<i> to implement a scripting language similar to Lisp for NoteEdit 
</I>&gt;<i> (command-line beside the mouse&amp;keyboard interface, macro&amp;plugin support) 
</I>&gt;<i> and a more advanced NoteEdit API (so the scripts written could do 
</I>&gt;<i> anything useful at all). Well, I probably won't even get among those 200 
</I>&gt;<i> lucky projects, but anyway:).
</I>
I'm against a lisp scripting language as it is for the normal user much
more complicated to learn than an object oriented programming language.
My favourite is ruby. Concerning Lilypond: If a user is able to make 
changes in his lilypond score that touch the lisp interface of lilypond
than he has completely different abilities than a normal NoteEdit user
has. Many of the possible NoteEdit users I know would ever dare to touch
a script written in a lisp language.

The first step for an advanced API is to actually document the API. The
base is of course the doxygen documentation and with that I would have
to find out where the interface between the script and NoteEdit has to
be drawn. The NoteEdit library is too big as an API for the scripting 
language itself (actually it contains complete NoteEdit, I ask myself
why the library is so big). What could be inside the API ?

- control of all typesetting elements
- control of staff / voices
- editing control
- file control
- Midi interface control
- import/export control

Things like transposition, change clef etc. should be done via scripts
or macros in the future. Also my idea is to provide many default macros 
to the user as a base for composition work and for own scripts/macros.

There probably is no real difference between macros and scripts. I would
call a macro a short script which can be recorded and played back within
noteedit. This would be another way to create a basic script that can
later be expanded with your favourite text editor :).

Currently I can't really imagine why NoteEdit requires a real plugin
support. I think scripting / macros support is enough. It still probably
will be painful enough to expand NoteEdit so that a scripting interface
can be created.
