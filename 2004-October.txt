hmmm
if somebody  is interested in working this.... 
I think that the integration with KDE to provide many functionalities. Windows 
users have many other options to make music.

This is a good idea.
Create a plugin interface to make easy create converters.
Perhaps make a small "container" to execute plugins in command line. Then it 
is easy to make converters as
lilypond -> musicxml
abc -> musicxml
musicxml -> lilypond
etc
Ideas?

I am working in an importer for lilypond, using flex and bison (lex and yacc). 
I place this as wish?
