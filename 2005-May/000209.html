<PRE>Hi Matev&#382;,

I'd prefer to have the release ready one week earlier due to the
Linuxtag event occuring on 22. - 25. June.

&gt;<i> - there are some critical bugs, but not so complex to resolve (at least 
</I>&gt;<i> LilyPond multivoice export (Georg?) and MusicXML polyphony import bug 
</I>&gt;<i> (I'll try to fix it), which mess up the score!).
</I>
Great, that would be really good.

&gt;<i> - we have to update all the documentation (NE docbook) and make sure it 
</I>&gt;<i> works. This includes updating the homepage as well.
</I>
Yes, I'll have to make screenshots for the new staff properties and 
several changes concerning how it works now. As for the homepage, there
was already some suggestion for a &quot;NEWS&quot; section including the current
version of NoteEdit. Also the documentation should be included.

&gt;<i> - remove ALL the links in source, debugging, error messages, 
</I>&gt;<i> documentation pointing to the Joerg's web site or mail and replace them 
</I>&gt;<i> with our team's one.
</I>
I didn't even know they exist :-). Maybe it's better to have some
real context sensitive help in this case, but I don't know how much
we have todo for it. Also I'd like to avoid double work on both
the documentation and the context sensitive help.

&gt;<i> - some lipstik would be nice - reinvestigate and rewrite any messages, 
</I>&gt;<i> option menus and other signs which are wierdly written (the program 
</I>&gt;<i> should look nice and tidy as possible, at least no lower/upper case 
</I>&gt;<i> randomly placed. I'd also propose that we should name our project 
</I>&gt;<i> NoteEdit and not Noteedit or Note edit or Note Edit and stick to the 
</I>&gt;<i> name everywhere then. What do you think?).
</I>
That's a good idea, f.e. Georg pointed me to the &quot;Close all&quot; menu point.
It should be just &quot;Close&quot; and replace &quot;Quit&quot;. &quot;Close all&quot; should then
be renamed to &quot;Quit&quot;. That's much more logical and is quickly done.

Have you looked at my QT-variant of the menus ? I've corrected all the
menus and I would use this naming. Things like &quot;AutoBar&quot; is no proper
english but sounds to me like a variable or function name. It really
should be called &quot;Auto bar&quot;.

&gt;<i> - contact all the translators to update their work (currently, I only 
</I>&gt;<i> keep Slovenian translation up to date, other .po files get more and more 
</I>&gt;<i> fuzzily translated)
</I>&gt;<i> - new splash, new icon, makefile/svn building methods etc.
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i> I'll try to contact the translators this evening and tell them our 
</I>&gt;<i> situation.
</I>
Great!

&gt;<i> Also, I'd prefer as much testing as possible and production work (I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> going to write 2 compositions in NoteEdit this month and print them with 
</I>&gt;<i> LilyPond, maybe an arrangment for the choir as well). When we got 2.8.0 
</I>&gt;<i> released, I'll contact the official Debian maintainer.
</I>
Hmm, you just take a lot of work from me :-). As soon as the first beta
is out I'll do some announcements as well.

&gt;<i> Please have a look at the upcoming icon I'm about to post and check the 
</I>&gt;<i> dev forum if you have time and tell a thing or two about yourselves:). I 
</I>&gt;<i> hope I'm not too intruding... I just wanted to suggest the plan and hear 
</I>&gt;<i> your thoughts, although I'm not a project coordinator.
</I>
One thing that might be helpful is to write down what everyone has 
tested and the test results in the form:

Test case         Expected Test result        Comment   Test Ok (Yes/No)

The test case and the test result should be written in a way that
it is easily reproducible and unambiguous.

And the next time we want to test, we just need to do adjustments
to the test document(s). As noteedit is a quite complex application
this should make it easier to get an overview of what has been tested.
If you don't know how to start on that, take the documentation as
a base for tests.

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann
