Well I went already months ago through all the pain with geometry(),
DesktopWiget and friends so I had the solution already in may mind ;-)
The config / qrect combination I found in the kde manual, so I was
quite happy how easy this could be done. Otherwise I'd used 4 config
entries instead of only one. Maybe that's even the better solution
for future NoteEdit versions.

&gt;<i> Oh well, sometimes I just feel being to immature for this project,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
It's only a matter of experience. Three years of coding with Qt
later it will be much easier ;-)

Kparts is a collection of KDE classes. It is KDE's component object 
model, allows an application to embed another within itself. Doesn't
sound that familar ? KParts can also interface with the KIO trader to 
locate available handlers for specific mimetypes or services/protocols.
(Most of this was from the KDE homepage).

I don't know if kparts is only used for embedding NoteEdit into a
webbrowser (I haven't managed to get that run correctly but that's a
different topic) or also for other things.

Yep, this time I did :)
