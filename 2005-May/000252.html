<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> with the new menues, when I add another voice to a stave, I get without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> beeing asked a name for the stave &quot;zeile 1&quot; and so forth. This shouldn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happen, because most of the time I don't want a name for the staff.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It's well now, thanks. I like that still the selected staff shows up as
preselected.

&gt;<i> &gt; Could you please add a key binding for playback if it's not set yet.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd consider it as a big RFE IMO.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That was done as well. I use Spacebar for playback, Insert for insert
</I>&gt;<i> rest and end for the edit mode. If someone has a better solution with
</I>&gt;<i> less default keys changed feel free to post it.
</I>&gt;<i> Also the translation was updated for that as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Problematic for shure is the insert button: It's often needed, for
toggling the edit mode, I wouldn't cancel nor change that.

The space bar is a good choice for playing, although it was in the hot
key list reserved to insert rests, but didn't work. When working with a
midi keyboard, to insert rests with space would still be my first choice.

Inserting rests with the right mouse button is not so cute in the long
run, I think. I would connect context menues to it. Shift left mouse
button would be a good choice for inserting rests, and it's still free.

In any case, that should be kept configurable. Hopefully I didn't
confuse you too much :)

Regards,
Georg.
