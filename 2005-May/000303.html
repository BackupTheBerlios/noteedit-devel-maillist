</I>
Hello :)

Well, FreeBSD does not have glibc, it has its own c library (and 
pthread is probably a separate library).

&gt;<i> OTOH I don't know if it is really needed for tse3 or if tse3 can
</I>&gt;<i> be build without it. So I'm a bit reluctant on adding a dependency
</I>&gt;<i> for that case.
</I>
It's easily possible that one of the used base libraries requires it 
and not TSE3 itself.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; b) compiling with gmake gets pretty far but finally stops as the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; alloca.h include file could not be found (what's that for?). I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; couldn't locate it on my system, what is it used for? Can anyone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; send me a copy of it? Is it part of any package (which one?).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Logfile attached.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A copy was send to you by Matevz. alloca.h is part of glibc 2.3.4.
</I>&gt;<i> It defines the alloca function.
</I>
It's also part of the FreeBSD libc, .... responding to your second 
mail right away: if alloca.h is included by stdlib.h then it's really 
better to just remove all #include &lt;alloca.h&gt;  (I'll go about this 
tomorrow and send a patch). FreeBSD does not have alloca.h - it's 
directly included in stdlib.h (at least man alloca tells me to 
include stdlib.h)

And the alloca.h issue is NOT a autotools issue, it's purely source 
code related. The other one (adding -lpthread) is autotools related.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Besides: Rosegarden does not run on FreeBSD at all as it is tied
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the Linux sound system (ALSA). But I do not want all that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; midi/synthesizer(??) or other extra stuff, just a well working
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; note editing software - based on KDE if possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently noteedit is based on KDE. That might change however in
</I>&gt;<i> the future. The stable branch (soon 2.8.x) will still be based on
</I>&gt;<i> KDE for a quite long time I suppose.
</I>
What else would you use? Qt only? Or sth completely different (what 
could be better than that?).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think there is not much that prevents noteedit from running on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; FreeBSD, I'm familiar with software development, so I'll do my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; best to get Noteedit working FreeBSD and provide you with some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; patches and probably create a port - so every FreeBSD user can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just install it right away.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That really sounds great! Here we usually only provide sources for
</I>&gt;<i> download and they should theoretically compile and run on every
</I>&gt;<i> system having KDE3, QT3 and TSE3 (see INSTALL), though I only have
</I>&gt;<i> tested on Linux based systems.
</I>
Yes, it looks like most of it compiles out-of-the-box, just the few 
quirks you encounter if you never test it here, nothing serious I 
suppose (I don't have a complete build so far).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm also playing the piano for 15 years now and the violin for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ... more than 10 years, so I also know lot's about notes in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; general (some theory...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So what are you doing with NoteEdit ?
</I>
Editing notes :)   (and really just that, not playing around with a 
full synthesizer, so I'm more tending to the composer approach. 
Still, playing one or the other track with midi output is certainly 
nice to have as well).


And thanks very much for the warm welcome :)

</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
