&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>
Hi Anonymous,

&gt;<i> I have first found noteedit in SuSE 8.0 and now I want to start doing 
</I>&gt;<i> some note editing on my machine. Meanwhile all my systems run FreeBSD 
</I>&gt;<i> so of course I try to install it there (it's not in the ports 
</I>&gt;<i> collection - which might change soon...).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, trying to compile it on FreeBSD has so far produced these 
</I>&gt;<i> results.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> a) please add -lpthread to the TSE3 tests in configure
</I>
Any help for that would be appreciated :-). We use configure.in.in
as the basic script and create configure from here. AFAIK pthread
library is part of glibc 2.3.4 so I wonder why the test fails.
OTOH I don't know if it is really needed for tse3 or if tse3 can
be build without it. So I'm a bit reluctant on adding a dependency
for that case.

&gt;<i> b) compiling with gmake gets pretty far but finally stops as the 
</I>&gt;<i> alloca.h include file could not be found (what's that for?). I 
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't locate it on my system, what is it used for? Can anyone send 
</I>&gt;<i> me a copy of it? Is it part of any package (which one?). Logfile 
</I>&gt;<i> attached.
</I>
A copy was send to you by Matevz. alloca.h is part of glibc 2.3.4.
It defines the alloca function.

&gt;<i> Besides: Rosegarden does not run on FreeBSD at all as it is tied to 
</I>&gt;<i> the Linux sound system (ALSA). But I do not want all that 
</I>&gt;<i> midi/synthesizer(??) or other extra stuff, just a well working note 
</I>&gt;<i> editing software - based on KDE if possible.
</I>
Currently noteedit is based on KDE. That might change however in the
future. The stable branch (soon 2.8.x) will still be based on KDE for a
quite long time I suppose.

&gt;<i> I think there is not much that prevents noteedit from running on 
</I>&gt;<i> FreeBSD, I'm familiar with software development, so I'll do my best 
</I>&gt;<i> to get Noteedit working FreeBSD and provide you with some patches and 
</I>&gt;<i> probably create a port - so every FreeBSD user can just install it 
</I>&gt;<i> right away.
</I>
That really sounds great! Here we usually only provide sources for
download and they should theoretically compile and run on every system 
having KDE3, QT3 and TSE3 (see INSTALL), though I only have tested
on Linux based systems.

&gt;<i> I'm also playing the piano for 15 years now and the violin for ... 
</I>&gt;<i> more than 10 years, so I also know lot's about notes in general (some 
</I>&gt;<i> theory...)
</I>
So what are you doing with NoteEdit ?

Best regards,
