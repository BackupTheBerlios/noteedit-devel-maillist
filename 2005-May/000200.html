<PRE>High Matev&#382;,

I like your idea, it will give us a fresh, let's say lively, image.

&gt;<i> It contains the images of G. P. da Palestrina (as father of
</I>&gt;<i> renessaince's counterpoint) and J. S. Bach (as father of thirds
</I>&gt;<i> functional harmony). In background, there is my scanned notebook
</I>&gt;<i> showing a harmony homework (with errors) :-). The splash screen should
</I>&gt;<i> represent a strict composition tool offering rich talent and fullness
</I>&gt;<i> of knowledge and tools (red errors in my homework) meant for
</I>&gt;<i> composing. Tell me what you think!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>These associations are very much in the direction I see the usefullness
of noteedit too. I may only state according to my taste:
-- the pictures of the composers are too hidden, covered, don't have
enough contrast, are not recognized
-- there are too man notes, very few notes, with mistakes, should be
enough. A zoom of less then half the notes?
-- the colors are tasteful, very classical. A little more jazzier I
would suggest (but don't know what it is :) )

The muse splash I like very much. Especially the lyra, which also
appears on the small icon in the menu bar and the control line. This
comes to my mind, because the small icon of noteedit I don't like, and
could maybe hold one note, time sig or key of the splash screen?

Your selection of the composers made me even dream more of the features
I would like to see when we did some more bug hunting: Whithout any gui
tweek I would like, when I open a second noteedit window, load a file
my_macro.not. There I have a few staffs named rhythm_x, scale_y, and so on.

When I insert music by the midi keyboard while some part of rhythm_x is
selected, the rhythm of the selected part is (repeatedly) taken for the
timing of the notes I play. This would speed up inserting second voices,
similar patterns, etc. When scale_y is selected, the selection of sharps
and flats are immediately chosen according the taste reflected in this
scale, espescially up/down preferences.

Maybe it's still a little bit far, this level of  noteedit work, but I'm
at least already looking forward to the new release and a nice splash
screen.

Best Regards,
Georg.
