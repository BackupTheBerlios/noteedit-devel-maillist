<PRE>Ok, so the 2.8.0 is our main goal now. IMO we should take some more time 
for the release then. I'd say a final release in mid-June if that's 
acceptable? (we're making a 2.8.0 stable) I think we should acomplish 
the following stuff till the release:
- there are some critical bugs, but not so complex to resolve (at least 
LilyPond multivoice export (Georg?) and MusicXML polyphony import bug 
(I'll try to fix it), which mess up the score!).
- we have to update all the documentation (NE docbook) and make sure it 
works. This includes updating the homepage as well.
- remove ALL the links in source, debugging, error messages, 
documentation pointing to the Joerg's web site or mail and replace them 
with our team's one.
- some lipstik would be nice - reinvestigate and rewrite any messages, 
option menus and other signs which are wierdly written (the program 
should look nice and tidy as possible, at least no lower/upper case 
randomly placed. I'd also propose that we should name our project 
NoteEdit and not Noteedit or Note edit or Note Edit and stick to the 
name everywhere then. What do you think?).
- contact all the translators to update their work (currently, I only 
keep Slovenian translation up to date, other .po files get more and more 
fuzzily translated)
- new splash, new icon, makefile/svn building methods etc.

I'll try to contact the translators this evening and tell them our 
situation.

Also, I'd prefer as much testing as possible and production work (I'm 
going to write 2 compositions in NoteEdit this month and print them with 
LilyPond, maybe an arrangment for the choir as well). When we got 2.8.0 
released, I'll contact the official Debian maintainer.

Please have a look at the upcoming icon I'm about to post and check the 
dev forum if you have time and tell a thing or two about yourselves:). I 
hope I'm not too intruding... I just wanted to suggest the plan and hear 
your thoughts, although I'm not a project coordinator.


Regards.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ok, version 2 inbound:). I'm thinking about changing the icon for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2.8.0 as well. Still collecting ideas though:). Leon, Reinhard, I'd 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> release version 2.7.5 asap, so we could start preparing for a major

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and remake the .po files this evening. But then, I'm pretty go for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2.7.5.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, I will already release 2.8.0 due to the changes to the menu 
</I>&gt;<i> structure and the merge of the two dialogs. I think this will be a
</I>&gt;<i> good start for the stable release cycle and we still can do some more
</I>&gt;<i> UI changes. Also I'd start first a 2.8 Beta 1 so if you still want
</I>&gt;<i> to make more menu changes go for it, so we can go for a second
</I>&gt;<i> beta or rc before we finally release it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I like the splash screen now much better and would integrate
</I>&gt;<i> it into the 2.8 release.
