Hi Reinhard!

When I hit File->Print preview, it does nothing. And when I hit
File->Print... it freezes. I'm using ./configure --enable-debug
--with-printing, otherwise, it doesn't even compile (printLayout not
defined). Also, I'm unable to export to MusicXML file format. It
freezes, when I hit start export button in export dialog.

Known issues?

Well for me for unknown reasons printing does not work correctly.
I get an error message saying he could not print the postscript
file (unknown file types). I haven't tested MusicXML, so I have
to look into it. Strange it does not compile. printLayout is
declared in configuredialog.h and defined in configuredialog.cpp
and I checked that it is in SVN and also has all the
WITH_DIRECT_PRINTING defines.

Concerning printing (Still only implemented for ABC): As I got
the error I tried to find out what went wrong. This morning
I have tried to find out why it crashes for me after printing
failed. Up to know I have no clue why it happens. Also I still
search for an example using kprinter and the printFiles method
properly. I changed line 3992 to
IntPrinter *printer=new IntPrinter(tmpFile + ".ps");
but it still does not work. Next I'll try something
on the QStringList parameter of printFiles.

Reinhard Katzmann

Hi!

Did you try using NoteEdit itself to export to ABC music, using
"File->Export->ABC Music"?

However, a new printing code is being worked on (you should be able to
print directly using 3rd party typesetting program - Lily, ABC etc.,
using a simple Print preview and Print buttons in NoteEdit) for the
upcoming 2.8.1 release.

Hi Matevz and all,

I partially fixed the printing probs. There is no more crash when
trying to print but on my system I still get the error that I have
no access rights to print the postscript file created.

I tested musicxml export on ballade no.1 with success, so there must
be something special about your file leading to a crash.

Can you provide a backtrace of your problem with musicxml export ?

Reinhard

Yes, I traced the problem yesterday and it's something at my place. If I
run NoteEdit separately, it works fine. But if I run it in KDevelop
debugger, it crashes. Nothing important I believe.

I'll test the new printing code asap. Do we have any release date for
2.8.1 set?

Hi Matevz, Georg, Csaba and all,

Did you read the announcement from the LAA list beginning of November ?
Just in case I cite the most important information:

--
This mail is to announce the calls for papers/music/etc for the 4th
International Linux Audio Conference (LAC2006).
See http://lac.zkm.de/2006 for more information.

LAC2006 will take place 27-30 April 2006, again at the ZKM | Institute for
Music and Acoustics in Karlsruhe, Germany.
--

Personally I want to participate again as last year but don't want to
spend my small free time for NoteEdit on writing a paper but continuing
on the development (especially the scripting engine). But it would be
in ideal possibility to do an inofficial NoteEdit developer meeting and
do a workshop or a NoteEdit demo of the new features we have developed
until then.

I think the conference itself is worth a visit and this years conference
already had a large inspiration on the development. What do you think ?

Regards,

Reinhard

Current changes on the printing:

Three new methods for print export, preview, print itself. Fixed some
bugs and added lilypond support. The -o option does not seem to work on
my system when adding a path.

I'd really prefer to create all files in a temporary directory instead
in the directory where NoteEdit was started. Yesterday again after
previewing an abc file a postscript file was not deleted though it
should have and was left behind on my desktop. It would be nice to
know if older or more recent version than 2.6.3 of lilypond work for
you with the -d option.

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] DE Eclipse 3
Message-ID: <4386B7D2.3030605@web.de>

Hi,

Last weekend I have fought with Eclipse DE so I can use it as an better
alternative than kdevelop. Everything seemed to work fine except the
relative new KDE/Autotools Plugin for Eclipse (this project just started
in August this year as it seems).

I have two problems currently:
- Everything is compiled in a build directory, so some include pathes
are missing (probably need to be added to the main Makefile.am)
- I have found no way to change the configure option. This is of course
a must have when I want to continue on printing development and enable
debugging :-)

Here is the work you have to do to get it basically going (Eclipse 3.1):

1) Install eclipse-platform, eclipse-cdt (including the sources/devel,
   so you be able to update online!). You need to have a java client
   installed (gcj, kaffeine should work)

2) Grap kde-eclipse from
   http://kde-eclipse.pwsp.net/index.php?filename=downloads.html
   and follow the instruction on the page. (On my mandriva system
   the eclipse directory is in /usr/share/eclipse, on ubuntu it should
   be /usr/local/lib/eclipse

3) Install subclipse (subversion support for eclipse) from
   http://subclipse.tigris.org/ either manually as described
   on the download page or via
   Help => Software Updates => Find and install =>
   Search for new features to install => Next
   New Remote Site => Subclipse; http://subclipse.tigris.org/update; OK
   Finish
   Check Subclipse => Next => Accept => Next => Finish => Install

4) If you haven't already a working (and perhabs modified) working
   directory like me I recommand to setup a new subversion workspace:
   Window => Open Perspective => SVN Repository Exploring.
   On the SVN Repository perspective (tab) select the (rightmost)
   "Add SVN repository" tool button.
   Use the URL svn://svn.berlios.de/noteedit/trunk (root is
   svn://svn.berlios.de/noteedit). Enter username / passwd if you
   want to be able to commit your files.

5) You should now have the trunk as a list of files (containing
   directories like admin, doc, noteedit).
   On the svn://svn.berlios.de/noteedit/trunk directory use the
   right mouse button and select "Check Out As...". Select
   "Standard KDE Project". On the project Dialog I have entered
   "NoteEdit" as project Name, "See AUTHORS" as Author, my email
   adress. After finishing you should see the checkout process.

6) First we want to be able to build NoteEdit. Thanks to the
   kde-eclipse automates the steps you usually do manually:
   make -f Makefile.cvs; ./configure --enable-debug; make;
   (make install). To build the project you can use the build
   tool button (Create project) or the corresponding context
   menu entry of "NoteEdit [trunk]" on the C/C++ Projects
   perspective.

At this point building failed for me. The bad thing is that
the eclipse does somehow not recognize this fact and reports
"Success". Also note that a src directory gets by the plugin
which can be deleted (I don't know why this happens).

Regards,

Reinhard

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Hotkeys do not work
Message-ID: <4386BDA3.7070706@web.de>

Hi,

This is from the help forum:

Recently I have noticed a few bugs:

1) noteedit won't compile with g++ > 3.x The current version of g++ in
many distros is 4.x However, SuSE applies a patch for enabling
compilation with 4.x

2) when compiled under KDE 3.5 RC1, Qt 3.3.5 or if one compiles version
2.8.0, the hotkeys cease to work. Compilation works, though.

Any ideas ?

My current system is a SuSE 10.0, KDE 3.4.2 and qt 3.3.4. I would like
to upgrade to KDE 3.5.x and qt 3.3.5 but then -> noteedit loses a lot of
functionality due to the lack of hotkey access.

Any ideas ?

Thanks
Thomas

      1) We have a patch in SVN for gcc4 to work, actually you only need
a new configure script. The patch 599 should help you though it was a
bit improved in svn.

      2) I have no qt 3.3.5 and no current KDE on my Mandriva 2006
system. There was patch 679 to probably fix it but I cannot check it myself.

      I won't upgrade to the latest qt/kde versions until they are
stable in my distribution (i.e. about february/march 2006). I hope some
of our developers has the possibility to test it with a more recent
version. Is there a stable live CD/DVD (KUbuntu/Knoppix) with the latest
KDE/QT ?

      Regards,

      Reinhard

            I just checked the patch and it does not resolve the hotkeys
            problem. I'll write a mail on the development list.

It might be the meanwhile deprecated hotkey usage in NoteEdit causing
problems but I really don't know. It's not difficult to change but
still quite some work to do it due to the large number of changes
(mainframewidget.cpp).

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Missing features
Message-ID: <200511251534.10469.mail@schultzm.de>

Hello list!

I do like noteedit very much, although there are a number of features which 
should be implemented:

- it should be possible to move the notes horizontally, e.g. if an half note 
and an eighth note with the same height are placed together (two parts in one 
line)

- it also should be possible to move a break vertically, if one sets two parts 
in one line

- the MusixTex-export would be more usable, if the code would be generated 
using "\selectinstrument\xx" instead of "&" and just "\notes"... Then one 
could print excerpts with some of the used instruments easily.

- noteedit should support the commands "\caesura" and "\cbreath" (from 
musixTex)

I have a little (and just a little) experience with programming and would 
enjoy to help with these features.

Greetings
Michael

I'm not sure what do you have in mind by 'moving notes horizontally'. Do
you mean voices? If so, go to Format->Staff properties->Voices and
create a new voice. You can cycle through voices by left/right clicking
the rectangle showing the current voice number. Voices are independent
one of another. For further information about handling multiple voices,
look at
http://noteedit.berlios.de/doc/mulvoices.html

Hm... what do you mean by break? NoteEdit writes the whole score into
single line, without page or line breaks. If you mean rests, you can
simply place them in individual voices independently one to another.

Yes, features like caesura and breath signes are on the wishlist. I
myself prefer Lilypond typesetting program for printing and publishing
though (the export filter is also currently the best IMO), but when
these features will be implemented, the export filters for all the
supported formats are probably going to be updated as well.

Yes, there's a bug in my lily-2.6.3 as well. The problem is that the .ps
file is created fine, but when it's converted, it's placed in a folder
where Lily was executed from. I already send a bug report to Lily list.

Me too! I found out that this was the problem from the beginning, why
NoteEdit crashed when running it in debugger inside KDevelop.

No. 2.6.x version of Lily brought -d option.

Is there a way to print as .pdf as well somewhere (I could add an --pdf
option beside, but the print command is still hardcoded to .ps right?)?
If yes, we could place a shortcut to file menu "Export PDF" as well...

Sorry for being to confusing. The problem I'm referring to is the following: 
Imagine a line with two voices. Voice 1 has to play 1/2 note, let's say g'. 
Voice 2 begins at the same time with 1/8 g' (of course there are a number of 
notes following during the 1/2 note of voice 1, but this doesn't matter). 
Noteedit sets both g' together, the one of voice 2 with a stem down (and a 
flag), the one of voice 1 with a stem up. Because one of the notes is an 
eigtht (could be a quarter too), the head of the note is filled.
The problem: you can't see, that voice 1 plays an half note, it looks like a 
quarter note (you have to count the notes to find it out). The usual solution 
is to move the half note one width of a note to the left or the right, so 
both g' are lying side by side.

Yes, I meant rest (sorry for my english). The problem is, that you can move 
ALL notes of one voice up or down. But sometimes a voice containes notes in 
an area, where the rest of the other voice would be placed usually. Then you 
have to lower or raise the rest to avoid it be placed over the notes.

Yes, you're refering to the score layout and rendering problems. I have
lots of those in my TODO list as well, but unfortunately, there are many
issues that have to be resolved before (like proper export to the
current formats, complete migration to QT4 library, MIDI playback bugs
and more!). Beautifying of notes, better layout and so on are a bit less
important (although *very* annoying!), but I'm gonna look at them asap.


Best wishes!

Great, thanks for the hint. Now I can continue implementing the next
print export.

Well I changed quite some things on the printing class so I did no
longer encounter a crash even when this case should happen. Still
sometimes the postscript files does not get deleted (Happened once
with abc preview). Don't know really why.

:-( So for lilypond preview 2.6.x seems to be more or less a
requirement. Alternatively I could try a one-line command sequence
or a short temporary bash script cd'ing into the temp directory
before export/print (preview).

Well currently abc is postscript only and for lilypond I use the pdf
file. The print file format can currently defined by a file type
as QString (".pdf", ".ps" ) for the print and print preview methods.
Export pdf does not really make sense for me, it would be better to
define the print format in the settings. You can already save the
file as pdf or postscript by changing the "Name" of the printer
from EpsonStylC86 (or whatever your printing queue name is) to
Print To File (PDF / Postscript).
