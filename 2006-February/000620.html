<PRE>Hello NoteEdit developers,

I completely agree to the post Matevz has written and really
hope you are not too much disappointed by our decision.

Some aspects I see as well I want to tell you as well. One
concern I have that NoteEdit should serve us as a base (from
the user point of view) what features Canorus should have.
So I'm aiming that we will port many things available now
in NoteEdit to Canorus. Parts we don't like will then of
course be replaced.

Especially I'm interested in keeping/porting one of the strongest
feature of NoteEdit and even enhance it: Import and Export.

Everything else are details and I really would be happy if you
decide to help us with our new project. As Matevz wrote I will
also not completely abandon this project but will do minor bug
fixes to the code as necessary.

Probably you have noted that we are behind the schedule concerning
the next NoteEdit release (mainy because of lack of time on my
side due to other music projects and work and also a bit of
motivation due to the current state ot the code). We will put
out one major new version somewhen in march.

Finally I like to thank all the people who have helped to made
it possible that NoteEdit became a good score editor (which it really
is, despite it's bugs). I will keep the project page,
even when there is no longer development in this project.

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

&gt;<i> Hello to all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We had a long-lasting conversations on IRC &amp; messanger with Reinhard
</I>&gt;<i> about the current NoteEdit state and issues for the past few days.
</I>&gt;<i> Myself, I've been thriving to fix a crescendo bug for 6 hours with no
</I>&gt;<i> luck, while he was fixing and polishing the last additions to the
</I>&gt;<i> printing code. During the talk we both agreed that the current structure
</I>&gt;<i> and development done in NoteEdit needs major reorganization and
</I>&gt;<i> restructuring, let it be transitions like Qt3-&gt;4 interface,
</I>&gt;<i> Makefile-&gt;Scons, non-object-oriented-&gt;complete-object-oriented,
</I>&gt;<i> manually-made-interface-&gt;qtDesigner-interface while on the other hand a
</I>&gt;<i> major rewrite and rethinking on the most parts of the code, as no
</I>&gt;<i> developer currently actually understands it due to a lack of code
</I>&gt;<i> documentation (comments, Doxygen, illogical variable names). In the end,
</I>&gt;<i> we came to a conclusion that we:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) completely rewrite the current NoteEdit project or
</I>&gt;<i> 2) begin a new project from scratch with no connection to NoteEdit
</I>&gt;<i> whatsoever
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We kind of agreed that a complete new project with a well-thought-out
</I>&gt;<i> base classes and structures from the beginning would be more appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> than a complete rewrite of NoteEdit having such a history. We decided to
</I>&gt;<i> officially create a new project, Canorus - a music score editor (canorus
</I>&gt;<i> - sweet, rich, full sounding in Latin). We also made some basic
</I>&gt;<i> guidelines of the project:
</I>&gt;<i> **
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     * Source view of the score
</I>&gt;<i>     * Command line &amp; Scripting language support (Ruby?)
</I>&gt;<i>     * XML file format
</I>&gt;<i>     * Qt4 and cross-platform ability
</I>&gt;<i>     * New Doxygen documentation
</I>&gt;<i>     * Primary library: Qt4.x
</I>&gt;<i>     * Primary IDE: Eclipse with Scons, Qt, Subversion and VEX plugins
</I>&gt;<i>     * Primary MIDI library: Midishare &lt;<A HREF="http://midishare.sf.net">http://midishare.sf.net</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Reinhard set up a project page at berlios (<A HREF="http://canorus.berlios.de">http://canorus.berlios.de</A>).
</I>&gt;<i> SVN and mailing lists should be up shortly, while the basic homepage
</I>&gt;<i> (mostly copied from NoteEdit) is already there. Also, I'm going to make
</I>&gt;<i> a Canorus' Wiki on Berlios. We decided that this time, development and
</I>&gt;<i> user Wiki should be common, both public. Currently, me and Reinhard are
</I>&gt;<i> the project admins and Georg is marked as a developer as well. Anyone
</I>&gt;<i> interested in development should contact me or him, if he wants to join
</I>&gt;<i> the team!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From my perspective, the main reason why Cantorus project was born is
</I>&gt;<i> the time needed for NoteEdit's further development and bug fixing due to
</I>&gt;<i> a bad structure and lack of code documentation (6 hours of unsuccessful
</I>&gt;<i> bughunting could be much better replaced by a quality coding and
</I>&gt;<i> thinking about the new project). Therefore I decided to alternate my
</I>&gt;<i> strength into the new project than losing precious time on NoteEdit.
</I>&gt;<i> I'll be there for any minor issues or fixes, but I'm not going to make
</I>&gt;<i> any larger further development of NoteEdit anymore.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best wishes and regards to all!
</I>&gt;<i> - Matev&#382;
