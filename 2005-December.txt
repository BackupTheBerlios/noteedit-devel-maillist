Hi Ken,

I wasn't aware of these install problems but you should always be
able to define the pathes via configure options. But we use the
default place for KDE icons so I think we would get problems with
other distributions like redhat. I can't judge it for my system
as it uses the menu system where every application has it's own
entry. Maybe some of the other developer has experience for redhat,
suse and debian. The icon path is defined in noteedit/icons/Makefile.am
so it shouldn't be difficult to write a patch for your distributions's
package.

On my system Noteedit is installed in (Multimedia)/Sound.

Regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] LAC2006 in Karlsruhe
Message-ID: <43AA9E66.3000504@schwaben.de>

Hello list,

the Call for Papers, Call for Music etc. for the 4th International Linux 
Audio Conference (LAC2006) is still running until January 8th, 2006. As 
I plan to attend a few days, I'll submit a BOF (birds of feather 
session) for NoteEdit. The poster from last year should be modified a 
little, I guess (to show progress). I would be glad to see some of you 
there.

On LAU where about three threads on NoteEdit. Just, if someone is 
interested. I posted one reply, among other things, that printing is in 
the works. I hope this was okay :)
During the years change I hope to work something on NoteEdit!!

Regards,
Georg

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Noteedit broken on KDE 3.5.0?
Message-ID: <43AF97C8.7070404@charter.net>

I built noteedit 2.8.0 on PCLinuxOS and it worked.  Then Texstar built 
noteedit 2.8.0 and abcm2ps rpms for the distribution.  I tried those and 
they also worked.  Then PCLinuxOS moved to KDE 3.5.0 and strange things 
happened with Noteedit.  (No other programs have showed this behavior.)  
The arrow keys quit working in noteedit, and the note insertion tool is 
permanently activated no matter what button is pushed on the toolbar. 
I will submit this bug to the pclinuxos developer's list as well.  I 
found the same problem on two computers, my laptop and my desktop 
computer.  I did a make uninstall, make clean, and make distclean, 
before I installed the rpm.  After removing the rpm,  I also tried to 
rebuild noteedit with the kdelibs but I got an error 2, after it was 
unable to find nscaleedit.h.

  -c -o staffProps.lo `test -f 'staffProps.cc' || echo './'`staffProps.cc; \
then mv -f ".deps/staffProps.Tpo" ".deps/staffProps.Plo"; \
else rm -f ".deps/staffProps.Tpo"; exit 1; \
fi

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Scons project administration
Message-ID: <43B3E416.8080702@web.de>

Hi,

I hope you all had a nice christmas eve and holidays. A little bit late
I have a present for you: NoteEdit scons project administration.

I've created scons files for NoteEdit. I want to move away from automake
tools (less dependency, less hassle with dependencies). scons supports
QT, I used bksys kde.py (actually kde.py from KDE svn fixing several
bugs like translation). I wrote a midi.py for TSE3 / kmid support and
added printing options to general.py (see scons_admin directory).

Building is simple: Just invoke scons without any parameters from
the 'trunk' directory. If you want to manually configure just  call
'scons configure' and the relevant options (Use scons -h to see the
options like debug=full). If you only want to build something in a
subdirectory do it this way: 'cd <subdir>; scons -u'.

To build and install NoteEdit with scons simply use 'scons install'.
You can also invoke 'scons' install as root after building it.

scons creates a cache and retrieves files from the cache if you delete
them manually. Manually this can be switched off with --no-cache.

The SConstruct is the main scons file residing in the main directory.
doc, kguitar_excerpt, noteedit have their own SConscript files being
invoked by SConstruct (env.BuildDir, env.subdirs).

On my system currently libnotedit.* is installed into the kde directory
and no longer into the $KDEDIR/lib directory. (that could be
/usr/lib/kde3 or /opt/kde/lib). This happends because I use kobject
from kde.py for creating the shared / static library and not the
official scons way (ToDo).

I haven't tested everything. There could be a problem with a missing
config.h file (either uncomment the corresponding line in the referenced
file and send problems afterwards to the list or copy config.h from
a different place). Also installation doesn't seem to install the
icons (at least I haven't wrote anything for these extra files only
needing to be installed but not to be build).

I use scons 0.96.1. I've seen that newer versions of scons are
available. I think it would be good to be able to reduce the cache
size used by scons (i.e. implicit --cache-disable). I can't recommand
the implicit cache as it seems to make the cache grow continuously.
Here you are free to make your own experiments.

Best regards

Reinhard

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] NoteEdit eclipse strikes again
Message-ID: <43B3EEB9.5060802@web.de>

Hi,

With scons I finally managed some debug sessions with Eclipse.
You need to install the sconsbuilder (Use as update page
http://nic-nac-project.de/~lothar/eclipse/update/ in the
eclipse update manager). Check out NoteEdit in the way
I already described:

3) Install subclipse (subversion support for eclipse) from
   http://subclipse.tigris.org/ either manually as described
   on the download page or via
   Help => Software Updates => Find and install =>
   Search for new features to install => Next
   New Remote Site => Subclipse; http://subclipse.tigris.org/update; OK
   Finish
   Check Subclipse => Next => Accept => Next => Finish => Install

4) If you haven't already a working (and perhabs modified) working
   directory like me I recommand to setup a new subversion workspace:
   Window => Open Perspective => SVN Repository Exploring.
   On the SVN Repository perspective (tab) select the (rightmost)
   "Add SVN repository" tool button.
   Use the URL svn://svn.berlios.de/noteedit/trunk (root is
   svn://svn.berlios.de/noteedit). Enter username / passwd if you
   want to be able to commit your files.

5) You should now have the trunk as a list of files (containing
   directories like admin, doc, noteedit). On the
   svn://svn.berlios.de/noteedit/trunk directory use the
   right mouse button and select "Check Out As...".

I couldn't test the check out step up to now but in my experience
up to now you can't directly create a scons project. Instead you
have to create a C/C++ project and after that you can add scons
administration to it using the "New -> Convert to Scons project" menu
entry from the context menu from the NoteEdit folder. Note that
changing the NoteEdit properties (project menu or context menu)
often overwrites the NoteEdit SConstruct file when changing the
scons options so make a copy in your workspace directory and restore
the original file (it also leads to compile errors due to the wrong
SConstruct file). I'll try to find a way to integrate the NoteEdit
SConstruct requirement with the sconsbuilder.

By default NoteEdit is automatically rebuild when you save a file
and scons uses the implicit cache mechanism. By changing the
scons properties you can switch this mechanism off (recommanded).
Also to be able to debug NoteEdit you have to add the variable
LD_LIBRARY_PATH to <path_to_home>/workspace/NoteEdit/noteedit
so the libnoteedit.so from this directory can be found. Also I
have uninstalled noteedit and libnoteedit from my system.

One of the reasons I want to be able to use eclipse is the
refactoring mechanism and an easier access to all the NoteEdit
classes. kdevelop is not bad in this regard but it's not as
platform independant as eclipse due to the fact that kde up
to now has used automake / autoconf. Another reason is cppunit
integration but that's a different story.

Regards,

Reinhard

To repeat myself (the plan has not changed):

Personally I want to participate again as last year but don't want to
spend my small free time for NoteEdit on writing a paper but continuing
on the development (especially the scripting engine). But it would be
in ideal possibility to do an inofficial NoteEdit developer meeting and
do a workshop or a NoteEdit demo of the new features we have developed
until then.

I think the conference itself is worth a visit and this years conference
already had a large inspiration on the development. What do you think ?

Regards,

Reinhard

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] New previewPrint class
Message-ID: <43B59F31.1060208@web.de>

Hi,

I separated the printing feature from mainframewidget.cpp.
I have created a new NPreviewPrint class having a small
interface to NMainFrameWidget (two methods, one for
preview and the other for printing). Currently these
function as well as the export manager do an initialization
of the export frame. In the future this should only happen
if necessary.

The print methods have been slightly changed and some code
duplication was removed. Lilypond preview does work now,
I still can't print with KDE on my system (though the temporary
file can be sent to the printer with lpr with no problem).
I also checked my cups file and only have an access to the
printer deamon but no actual log entry that there was an
invalid file type sent to cups as KDE printing system said to me.

I also changed uiconnect.cpp and splitted startExport in
a way that the export itself can be invoked separately
("doExport").

Regards,

Reinhard
