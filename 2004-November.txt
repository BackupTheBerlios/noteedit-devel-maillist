Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Lyrics Export to Lilypond with Ties
Message-ID: <418B4DF3.8010706@schwaben.de>

Hello all,

while looking around on lilypond-user I stumbled over
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-user/2004-01/msg00482.html
which is exactly what I was looking to repair.  I tryed it to solve by 
removing the " _ " for a tied note, but I don't oversee the source code 
enough yet...
Nevertheless, the attached patch allows me to export easily and 
correctly lyrics to lilypond (2.0.3). The abc-export I never tried, if 
it has a similar problem. Probably soon I'll look at that, also to 
lilypond 2.4, to check, if this patch should be applied.

Best Regards,
Georg.

Grabbing the latest svn version of NoteEdit, there are no configure,

Hi all,

tonight I accidently stumbled upon two NoteEdit MusicXML bugs, #2480 and 
#2487. If anyone is working on these, please let me know. If not, I will fix 
them, probably within a few weeks.

Regards, Leon.

This weekend I tried to build NoteEdit myself and experienced the same 
problems. I have created bug #2814 with detailed info and a crude workaround 
that results in a working NoteEdit.

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Version nr update
Message-ID: <HNEXFE08evWWGxegIqu00009e03@hnexfe08.hetnet.nl>

Dear Mr. Katzmann,

tonight I have fixed and committed bug #2487. As far as I know this is the 
first functional change compared to Joerg Anders' 2.7.3 source tree. 
Therefore I propose to update the version number to 2.7.4.

Furthermore, many svn files still refer to Joerg Anders' home page. I think 
these references should be replaced by references to the new berliOS home 
page. Of course, credit for creating NoteEdit should be given to Joerg Anders.

Is it OK with you if I make these changes ?

Best regards, Leon.

You are right, independently of changes being made in svn after a 
release the version should be increased. For the next release I'd
like to integrate an ia64 patch which is not yet on the patches list.

Yes of course. I agree that these changes should be made some time.

That would be a great help for us.

Hi all,

I may have some spare time available for working on NoteEdit shortly. In 
order to prevent wasting time, may I assume that all open bugs assigned to 
"none" are not being worked on ? In that case, whenever I feel like working 
on NoteEdit I will assign a bug to myself and fix it.

Regards, Leon.

I wonder, does Joerg Anders read this thread? I mean, he is the original 
author and I've been tracking his NoteEdit project since version 2.0. 
Many things happened in past 4 years and I just can't believe he gave up 
so suddenly. I wonder if he should join the new NoteEdit team in the future?


*my 2 cents:)*

Message-ID: <41A74548.70708@guest.arnes.si>

Could someone look and apply the patch I've just uploaded to the project 
page. I fixed a few LilyPond issues:
- added \version "2.0", so convert-ly now works out of the box (it knows 
which version to upgrade from)
- moved \voiceOne,\voiceTwo etc. to the separate lines (currently it was 
in the same line with \notes\relative, but shouldn't)
- fixed a small typo (LilyPoint -> LilyPond)

Hi,

I've uploaded the Makefile.cvs (Hmm, shouldn't we call it
Makefile.svn ? ;-) to the repository.

Usually make -f Makefile.cvs is enough to create the
configure file. I had success in September by rebuilding
the admin file using kdevelop 3.0.4. I've used exactly these
file on my updated Mandrake system (but not completely moved
to 10.1. official) but wasn't able to compile it. That's why
I decided not to upload these admin files (Beside that there
are just to many different automake version (1.4, 1.7,
1.8, 1.9, I use 1.7)).

You can use kdevelop for yourself to create a project and
update the admin files so they match for your system.

I suppose the compatibility problems never will get
really solved. I currently cannot recommand a KDE version
for trying it. I want to try it with kde 3.3.0 as soon as
I've updated my system.

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Makefile.svn is definitely way to go, but as cvs projects are still more 
common than svn project, Makefile.cvs is the expected name. Seems like a 
remark in README is useful.

At my system (Fedora Core 3) it does create a configure file, but the build 
still fails. The main issue here will probably be how to get NoteEdit 
specific options (--with-libtse3, --with-libkmid, --with-oldlily, 
--with-printing etc.) working correctly.

As I am rather unfamiliar with kdevelop and autoconf/automake I am afraid I 
won't be able to provide much help here, besides testing.

Best regards, Leon.
