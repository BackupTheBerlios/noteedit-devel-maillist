I'm having problem locating the libkguitar_excerpt.so. The copy is
located in kguitar_excerpt dir and in has a symlink in noteedit dir as well.

Any ideas?

If I do

, it works fine.

Hi Reinhard.

Now I have another problem :( .
I completely cleaned the /usr/local directory. And when I start noteedit
installed by scons install, I get segfault. I think it's something
missing. Does "scons install" even copy libnoteedit.so to usr/local?


Regards.

Hi Adam!

Keyboard shortcuts didn't work for me as well under Debian and KDE3.5.
Your fix is commited in R399.

I really don't have tested scons install up to now, so probably
not. The reason was mainly that I don't have two libraries installed
and the installed version being used for debug instead of the
version just compiled. I everything works well, scons should
install everything in the directory specified with prefix.

We can also talk on IRC (freenode:#noteedit) if you're online currently.

Reinhard

I'm looking at mainframewidget.cpp and I'd like some keys to react on
keypress event and others on keyrelease event. Currently, all the keys
react on keypress event. I'd like to show a Insert measureline dialog if
you'd hold the TAB key for more than a second or so.

Any ideas?

Hello to all.

In R403, I comitted many compiler warning fixes, among them I got rid of
mainframewidget.cpp and resource.cpp ones. The toughest problems to
solve were the unsigned<->signed integer conversions, which still exist
in places.

Please test!

Hi Georg.

I don't quite understand this. Usually, staffs which are "braced" don't
contain lyrics AFAIK. For eg. You have a piano or organ staffs (right,
left hand) connected with brace. So, you don't need lyrics here. Lyrics
usually appears when the staffs are connected with bracket (ChoirGroup
context in Lily) or the staffs aren't connected at all (e.g. piano +
vocal solo - only piano staffs are connected with brace, solo is separated).

Can you give an example of this?

Hi Matev?,

you're right that usually lyrics don't appear in a piano staff. But why to forbid it? The Choirstaff is still possible, and in simple songs it's handy to add the lyrics to the melody in the right hand, without opening an extra vocal staff. Don't see a problem yet.

Best Regards,
Georg

Hi Matev?,

key accelerators I like very much, I would like to encourage to improve
things in that direction. What you would like to accomplish with the
measure line dialog?

Some concern I would like to share: Probably this kind of keys operation
will not be adjustable in the keys configuration, which is inherited
from KDE. And, to have timing in the keys might be not the best
solution, maybe it would be better to intruduce a new mode.

Regards,
Georg

Hm... I don't know. I usually find myself wasting time when composing,
when I'm looking for the right bar in Insert dialog (double bar, end
bar, repeat etc.). I think holding a TAB key (or whatever key for
placing barlines already) for a longer time and showing a dialog then is
useful. Maybe even for some other elements, not just barlines.

About KDE accelerators. I don't exactly know how they're used or why
they exist anyway (ok ok, I'll gonna take a look at KDE.org and stop
complaining :) ). Meanwhile, I'll probably implement the measureline
dialog with SHIFT+Key_Tab combination :).

Reinhard, are there any Qt solutions to KDE accelerators or an
easy-to-maintain-both-solutions alternatives?

Hi Matevz,

I don't know about key release events. QKeyevent doesn't seem to
distinguish between release and press events. QKeySequence, if
is used to implement accelerators.
I'd find it strange if the program reacted on both key release
and press event. Of course you still could react on a key press
event by starting a timer when the key was pressed. But I have
no idea how to catch the release event.

Regards,

Does the SVN write access work for you guys? I'm having problems with
authorizing myself when I want to commit files via https. I also cannot
login myself into NE project page at Berlios via SSL.

Hi Matev?,

for me commit/login works at the moment, as usual. Sometimes they seem
to go offline. Probably we'll not have to wait very long to enjoy your work.

Hi.

I've just committed R405.

From ChangeLog:
* R405: ADDED:
          - implemented Insert special barline dialog
          - if an element is selected, barline is inserted right after
it. Otherwise, only the selected barline becomes the current item being
placed when you first click on the score.
          - added menu option Insert->Special barline...
          - added shortcut key SHIFT+Key_Tab for this
          - Escape key now unselects the current active sign to be
placed (e.g. barline)
          - Home/End keys hit multiple times select the first/last element
          - Home/End keys goes to the last X pos of the current staff
          - some other minor fixes and additions


Regards.
- Matev?

Hi Matev?,

usefull features! A small caveat: After startup I select a new sheet,
then hit SHIFT-TAB, and cancel or close the dialog, then after an
"internal error" display NoteEdit shuts down. It says "unknown sign",
errorcode -1.

This happens also when selecting a barline in a staff, then canceling
the dialog. The upper description seemed simpler to reproduce.

Thanks for this additions. I'll test more soon, Regards,
Georg

Thanks, fixed.

Do you think, this dialog could replace the separate insert double bar,
repeat bars and end bar options in Insert menu? I'd say yes for the
Insert menu. For the toolbar, I'd say we have to rearrange some other
stuff there as well.
For e.g. End bar button would many times be used more often than Change
instrument button and the second one is there in the toolbar, whereas
the first one isn't.

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] enum or constants?
Message-ID: <43F393BB.9020908@guest.arnes.si>

Hi.

I know I'm pretty PITA the last few days :), but there's another
issue/question that came to my mind:
Is there any common practice or a written/non-written rule about using
enumeration values over the predefined constants using #define SOMETHING
SOMEVALUE.
For eg. I'd like to have a currentMode_ property in mainframewidget,
that would hold the current mode state (select mode, insert mode, edit
mode, play mode etc.).
Is it better to use #define SELECT_MODE 0, #define INSERT_MODE 1 and so
on and to declare int currentMode_ then or to declare enum CurrentMode
{selectMode, insertMode, playMode etc.} and then declare CurrentMode
currentMode_ ?

Hi Matevz,

Enums for me are just what they are: enumberations, so
it is especially useful if you have comboboxes in the
user interfaces and replace their number with enum.

If the entry of comboboxes change under a certain
context, you can even use a simple mapping to map
the used entry to the real enum number using a
vector:

typedef enum
{
  Entry_First    = 0,  // Not necessary, just for easier identification
  Entry_Special,
  Entry_All,
  Entry_Notes,
  Entry_Usual,
  Entry_Tea,
  Entry_Coffee,
  Entry_NeverUsed,
  Entry_Last
} Entry_T;

int entryMap[10];
entryMap[0] = Entry_First
entryMap[1] = Entry_All
entryMap[2] = Entry_NeverUsed
entryMap[3] = Entry_Tea
entryMap[4] = Entry_Last

This way you can easily fill your combobox with
the entries until Entry_Last is found (or start
with the last entry until the first).

In your case it depends how you use the mode.
If several modes can be used at the same time,
I wouldn't normally use enums except you define
them in a way so you can bitwise and / or them:

typedef enum
{
  NEM_Select = 1,
  NEM_Insert = 2,
  NEM_Edit   = 4
   .
   .
   .
}
NoteEditMode_T;

Regards,

Reinhard

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Some Music XML bugs
Message-ID: <43F790F0.1080900@web.de>

Hi Leon,

When importing a music xml file I got the following errors in the import
filter:

- Tempo alla breve was imported as 2/2 instead of 4/2
- Multimeasure rests with 1 bar are interpreted as 64'th pause
- I got 4 extra 64'th pause in the first bar containing a 4 bar
  multimeasure rest
- 2 bar multimeasure rest did result in 2 64'th pause bars
- composer, title etc. is not read
- some mup warnings not visible in the resulting lilypond file.
  (after correcting the above bugs manually)

I've appended the music xml file to my mail.

Regards,

Reinhard

Hi,

I just checked in a printing fix, so printing works now as expected.
One function used a global variable instead of the parameter. Also
I implemented PMX, MusiXTeX, Midi, MusicXML and mup/not (read from
file directly), but those are untested (I don't have pmx/musixtex
installed and the other three are experimental anyway).

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Canorus - a music score editor
Message-ID: <43FACDBA.1040004@guest.arnes.si>

Hello to all.

We had a long-lasting conversations on IRC & messanger with Reinhard
about the current NoteEdit state and issues for the past few days.
Myself, I've been thriving to fix a crescendo bug for 6 hours with no
luck, while he was fixing and polishing the last additions to the
printing code. During the talk we both agreed that the current structure
and development done in NoteEdit needs major reorganization and
restructuring, let it be transitions like Qt3->4 interface,
Makefile->Scons, non-object-oriented->complete-object-oriented,
manually-made-interface->qtDesigner-interface while on the other hand a
major rewrite and rethinking on the most parts of the code, as no
developer currently actually understands it due to a lack of code
documentation (comments, Doxygen, illogical variable names). In the end,
we came to a conclusion that we:
1) completely rewrite the current NoteEdit project or
2) begin a new project from scratch with no connection to NoteEdit
whatsoever

We kind of agreed that a complete new project with a well-thought-out
base classes and structures from the beginning would be more appropriate
than a complete rewrite of NoteEdit having such a history. We decided to
officially create a new project, Canorus - a music score editor (canorus
- sweet, rich, full sounding in Latin). We also made some basic
guidelines of the project:
**

    * Source view of the score
    * Command line & Scripting language support (Ruby?)
    * XML file format
    * Qt4 and cross-platform ability
    * New Doxygen documentation
    * Primary library: Qt4.x
    * Primary IDE: Eclipse with Scons, Qt, Subversion and VEX plugins
    * Primary MIDI library: Midishare <http://midishare.sf.net>


Reinhard set up a project page at berlios (http://canorus.berlios.de).
SVN and mailing lists should be up shortly, while the basic homepage
(mostly copied from NoteEdit) is already there. Also, I'm going to make
a Canorus' Wiki on Berlios. We decided that this time, development and
user Wiki should be common, both public. Currently, me and Reinhard are
the project admins and Georg is marked as a developer as well. Anyone
interested in development should contact me or him, if he wants to join
the team!

From my perspective, the main reason why Cantorus project was born is
the time needed for NoteEdit's further development and bug fixing due to
a bad structure and lack of code documentation (6 hours of unsuccessful
bughunting could be much better replaced by a quality coding and
thinking about the new project). Therefore I decided to alternate my
strength into the new project than losing precious time on NoteEdit.
I'll be there for any minor issues or fixes, but I'm not going to make
any larger further development of NoteEdit anymore.


Best wishes and regards to all!

Hello NoteEdit developers,

I completely agree to the post Matevz has written and really
hope you are not too much disappointed by our decision.

Some aspects I see as well I want to tell you as well. One
concern I have that NoteEdit should serve us as a base (from
the user point of view) what features Canorus should have.
So I'm aiming that we will port many things available now
in NoteEdit to Canorus. Parts we don't like will then of
course be replaced.

Especially I'm interested in keeping/porting one of the strongest
feature of NoteEdit and even enhance it: Import and Export.

Everything else are details and I really would be happy if you
decide to help us with our new project. As Matevz wrote I will
also not completely abandon this project but will do minor bug
fixes to the code as necessary.

Probably you have noted that we are behind the schedule concerning
the next NoteEdit release (mainy because of lack of time on my
side due to other music projects and work and also a bit of
motivation due to the current state ot the code). We will put
out one major new version somewhen in march.

Finally I like to thank all the people who have helped to made
it possible that NoteEdit became a good score editor (which it really
is, despite it's bugs). I will keep the project page,
even when there is no longer development in this project.

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Hi,

let me tell, at this occasion, that I had already a lot fun with
NoteEdit. If you developers decide to move forward, on another a
seperated codebase, even under another name, let it be. I'll try to
help, here and there. I also would like to thank everybody who worked on
NoteEdit, and all the other free software it depends on.

Hi Reinhard,

your xml file behaves the same way on the NoteEdit versions I have (2.7.3 and 
2.8.0).

The 2/2 I believe to be correct, as my music theory books state that alla 
breve is 2/2 and also the data in the xml file states 2/2 (<beats> and 
<beat-type> both are 2).

The 64th rest is of course incorrect, I will have to look into that. Will take 
a few days.

Regards, Leon.

Hi Reinhard,

the 64th rests (actually 128th) are in the xml file, but as breve (double 
whole) rests. These are not supported by NoteEdit, but the MusicXML importer 
thinks they are and tries to create them anyway (let's call that an xml 
import bug). This results in many "Unknown rest 1290240" messages, where 
1290240 is the internal representation of "double whole length". The rest 
itself (see NRest::calculateDimensionsAndPixmaps()) displays unknown rests as 
128th.

Possible solutions:

1) report an error when importing breve rests (easy)

2) detect breve rests but insert these as two whole rests (also easy)

3) support breve rests (more work, creating pixmaps and fixing NRest plus 
changing the GUI for inserting breve rests)

If you want, I could do 1) or 2) for you, but I don't have time to work on 3).

Warnings when exporting to Lilypond are also caused by the unknown rests.

Regards, Leon.
