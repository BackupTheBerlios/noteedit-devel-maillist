Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Canorus 0.2.5 is out
Message-ID: <45FF620C.9030604@gmail.com>

Canorus development team is happy to announce the new release of Canorus
- a free cross-platform music score editor, version 0.2.5. The release
took lots of effort from core developers, various contributors, testers
and translators. This release mostly brought huge under the hood
changes. Among others, the most notible features are the new GUI and
LilyPond support.

Finally we would like to mention a close-related project to Canorus,
Harmonia (http://harmonia.berlios.de). A project aimed at harmony
analysis which works as a Canorus plugin.

Changes summary:
- New Doxygen documentation.
- Initial work on MacOSX port.
- Improved function marking rendering
- Scripting engine now offers integration with Canorus menu, import/export
dialogs and keyboard and mouse events.
- New completely XML CanorusML format.
- LilyPond document export support.
- LilyPond voice import/export support.
- Rewritten GUI. Now supports multiple main windows. Added lots of icons.
- Translations support. Current translations: English, Slovenian.
- Majority of the code rewritten so we have a more robust foundation now for
future development.
- Lots of warnings, crashes, bugfixes and memory leaks fixed in MIDI,
GUI and
Scripting engine.

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] Canorus 0.2.5 Font Problem

Hello,

first of all my congretualtions to your fantastic achievements concerning 
Canorus development. If you like, I could maybe help doing German translation 
(but I need some instructions, how to do), or as well writing German 
documentation when Final Release is ready. Just call me if you need my help 
and if I find time I will contribute.

I noticed an interessting problem with the current release:

The fonts of notes and clefs were completely wrong on my system. Then I had an 
Idea: On my System, I installed Feta and Emmentaler Fonts of Lilypond as 
KDE-Fonts for me as main user. I need this to edit lilypond svg-output in 
Inkscape. So I created a new user account, restarted KDE and Canorus and: 
Fonts are displayed correctly. For this new user account, Feta and Emmentaler 
fonts are not available. I am not sure, if really this is the reasen, but it 
is my most convincing guess.

I added two screenshots, both showing the same xml-file, one on my account 
(with feta and emmentaler installed), one on the new test-account.

Best regards
Stefan Hackl
