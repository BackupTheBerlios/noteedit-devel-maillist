IRC-Log from Canorus:

<suamor> https not ? strange...
<suamor> it's quite slow but works
<thepianoguy> wow, https works
<thepianoguy> but http not
<suamor> yes
<thepianoguy> weeeird :(
<suamor> indeed
<suamor> insider tip i guess ;)
<suamor> BerliOS stands currently under a heavy DDoS attack (from >

<suamor> Meantime use https://www.berlios.de instead of
http://www.berlios.de to access BerliOS homepage as well as the
homepages of projects (https://projectname.berlios.de).
