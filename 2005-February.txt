Message-ID: <200502011745.32876.leon.vinken@hetnet.nl>

Hi guys,

title says it all: how do I upload a tarball to berliOS ? I can find a 
"download" but no "upload" button. If I can't do it myself, who do I send it 
to ?

I intend to create a 2.7.4 beta tarball today or tomorrow.

Regards, Leon.

Currently only me and Georg can do this.
I go to Admin -> Edit/Release files
I upload the tarball to ftp.berlios.de

After that I can start to create a new release.
You either have to be admin or release technician to do the job.
I had planned to do it myself.

I'd used the current source from SVN, create a release TAG to it
and add the old configure / admin files to the files and remove
the CVS specific files.

If you want to be a release technician, Leon, just tell me and
I change your user data.

Also I wanted to compile it on Mandrake 10.2 beta and Fedora
Core 3 for myself (tarball and rpms).

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Message-ID: <41FFE853.7050300@web.de>

Hi!

I have created a 2.7.4 tarball but not yet tested it. Differences to 2.7.3:

- 31 files were changed ;-)

Someone needs to update the Changelog file before we can make the 
release. This file should be used for the release changes we post
in the release manager as well.

I have found 8 missing Makefile.am files and checked them into svn.
This should solve most of the compile problems we have currently!
I really can't reproduce why they were lost from my noteedit archive
I checked into svn last autumn.

Also I changed de.po from the doc/de directory (Version 2.7.4).

Thanks to kdiff3 the great tool to not only compare files but
also directories (2.7.3 <-> 2.7.4).

Here is the tarball:

-rw-rw-r--  1 suamor suamor 1901324 Feb  1 21:36 noteedit-2.7.4.tar.gz

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Message-ID: <41FFED0F.2020004@web.de>

Hi!

I just wanted to know your opinion on future release.
I would prefere to introduce the following:

2.7.4.x Critical bugfixes for 2.7.4 release

2.7.5 New stable release

2.8.x Development releases with larger changes if
       we are in need for it:
- Changing the printing (system) of noteedit
- Replacing tse3 by something better ?
- Removing KDE depedency from noteedit ?

Therefore we would need to create a stable branch and
a development branch in svn.

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

This is what should be reported as user-visible changes, as far as I am 
concerned. Feel free to add these to a changelog or use them as the basis for 
your release notes.

New features:
- improved LilyPond support : added export in lilypond-2.4.2 format
- added Slovenian translation, thanks to Matevz Jekovec

Patches included (Matevz Jekovec):
- 000255 added \version "2.0", so convert-ly now works out of the box
         moved \voiceOne,\voiceTwo etc. to the separate lines
  fixed a small typo (LilyPoint -> LilyPond)

Bugs fixed:
- 002487 noteedit doesn't consider ties on MusicXML import
- 002528 triplets unfunctional
- 002532 multirests with one bar
- 002580 small type in INSTALL.de
- 002581 rest symbol printed twice
- 002807 rests should have fermatas as well
- 002809 measure numbers for other voices not printed in .ly file

Hi Reinhard,

I am not especially looking forward to the job of release technician, just 
trying to push 2.7.4 out of the door. I am perfectly happy with you making 
the release (even happier then when I would have to do it :-)).

Apparently, I was not clear enough about my intentions: I also made a tarball 
tonight. Doesn't matter, but let's try to avoid wasting time like this. Once 
again, I am perfectly happy with your version. Feel free to test and release 
it. In case you run into problems, I also have a version available that at 
least builds and works OK on Fedora Core 3. Let me know if you need it.

This is what I did:
unzip/untar noteedit-2.7.3.tgz
- note: be careful to check the five links in admin !
mv noteedit-2.7.3 noteedit-2.7.4-beta1
replace following files by svn versions:
- AUTHORS
- FAQ
- FAQ.de
- INSTALL
- INSTALL.de
- README
- VERSION
- doc/de/index.docbook
- doc/noteedit/index.docbook
- noteedit/* (all updated files)
- noteedit/po/Makefile.in
- noteedit/po/sl.po
note: don't copy:
- Makefile.cvs
- entire admin directory
edit 2.7.3 into 2.7.4 in:
- configure.in.in
- configure.in
- configure

If you need help in testing your tarball, I would be happy to do that too. 
Available platforms are Core 3 and RedHat 7.2 (old, but 2.7.3 still works on 
it). Just tell me where to download it from.

Regards, Leon.

A slightly different proposal, based on the Linux kernel versions:
use x.y.z with odd y's for development and with even y's for stable.

I believe this is a common numbering scheme, e.g. LilyPond also uses it. This 
would imply we need to copy 2.7.4 to a stable 2.8 release (with bug fixes in 
releases 2.8.1, 2.8.2 etc.).

New development would go into 2.9 (and, when stable, become 3.0).

Regards, Leon.

I just tested the tarball on my broken Mandrake system ;-) and it builds
and runs just fine! Also I tested on Fedora Core 3 (libtse3 from ccrma)
and it seemed to work there as well.

I decided to add it to the "NEWS" file instead to the Changelog. The
Changelog should contain Changes we make during development. It might
be sufficient to have SVN as a base for the Changelog, so we might
not need this file.

Hi!

I just tested the help menu on the build created yesterday.
I found out that
- The handbook cannot be loaded if KDE is in /usr and the
   doc file in /usr/local/kde (default directory for MDK 10.x)
- Problems with the program are still reported to Joerg Anders
   (maybe the first author from AUTHORS ?)
- Context sensitive help does not work.

Hi all,

The tarball looks good: It builds on a Suse 9.0 (kernel 2.4.21, kde 3.1) 
with just

      tar xvfz <tarball>
      cd noteedit-2-7-4
      configure --prefix=/opt/kde3
      make

as described in INSTALL.

On my Suse 9.2 x86-64 (kernel 2.6.8, kde 3.3) things look also okay: The 
Suse spec-skript/-patch is still needed. Thus to make a Suse rpm someone 
needs just replace 2.7.3-tarball with the new one.

Best Regards,
Georg.

Hi guys,

apparently I was too tired to think clearly yesterday, after a good night of 
sleep I had a "Eureka-moment" (would that be "aha-erlebnis" in german ?) and 
realized fixing yesterday's crash was trivial. The loop termination condition 
was incorrect. On my Core 3 system the bug did also occur, but not as a 
crash. Instead the listbox in "edit / cleanup rests" contained way too many 
strings.

Fix was committed to svn a few minutes ago. Hope nobody spent too much time on 
this.

Regards, Leon.

And I added a small update in lilyexport that for lily  2.4  drum notes 
go without warnings.

isn't it about time one of you uploads 2.7.4 ? I have not heard about any real 
issues for a few days anymore.

Hi,

The first beta (and probably the last and also the first and last 
release candidate ;-) for version 2.7.4 of noteedit has been released. 
Please test this hard and report any build problems to the developer 
mailing lists. You can also post bugs to the bug tracker.

You can download it from here:
http://developer.berlios.de/project/filelist.php?group_id=2232

I only know of one issue: The problem reports are still send
to Joerg Anders.

Message-ID: <4205500C.5080000@web.de>

Hi!

I've uploaded a first version of the new noteedit homepage. It
can be visited here: http://noteedit.berlios.de
Currently it is very simple and only based on the README.

It is also checked in into SVN. So you can send in your
patches or add your comments. We should have a designer
improving the homepage. Some ideas have already been
posted to the list beginning on 22. September (see ML Archives).

Also the homepage of Mr. Anders seems to be lost in the
happy hunting ground of some memory chips... I got some of
the original files (without screenshots) in case someone
wants to copy some of the original content.

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Hi Reinhard,

no offense taken :-).

Your remark about the value 12 is correct, a better solution would be to end 
the string table with a null. The way it is coded now has implicit knowledge 
about the table length in resource.cpp encoded in uiconnect.cpp which, of 
course, is a maintenance problem.

However, the same construction is used in more places and for a "last minute" 
fix I did not want to deviate from the existing coding style or rework it 
completely. Improving the coding style is something I prefer to do only 
during development, not in beta. For 2.7.4 we should aim for safety and fix 
only killing bugs using the smallest possible code change.

Regards, Leon.

Hi Reinhard,

thanks for making the release. I filed bug #3293 for your issue, which (IMHO) 
should be fixed before the final 2.7.4 release. It would not be polite to 
keep bothering Joerg Anders with bug reports.

Is there a specific address we can send bug reports to ? If not, then we 
should probably use something like "noteedit-devel at lists.berlios.de".

Regards, Leon.

Hi Georg,

created bug #3296 "Crash when ALSA synth not running" for this. Intend to fix 
it before 2.7.4, as I don't want crashes in production version software.

Usually I would not disagree, but in this case we have a small problem:
I have spam-protected the Mailing Lists of noteedit. So any mail sent to
to the list by someone not on the list will have no success (except I
explicitely agree to it). So maybe it's better to use my or Georg's
address (the berlios one) some developer who wants to be the bug admin.
Also I ask myself if we really should add the real E-Mail adresses to
the AUTHORS list. I think everyone has to decide for himself which 
address he wants to use. Maybe it's possible to hide the E-Mails in the
problem reports dialog.

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

Hi all,

I tested the tarball as a drop-in for the my suse 9.2 x86 src-rpm. It 
worked as expected. I think, with the contact issues fixed, the svn HEAD 
could be a 2.7.4 release. HEAD passed also a test.

Regards, Georg.

Hello,

thanks for the new homepage.

A few questions: From time to time someone has to upload the checked in 
version of index.html? I would also propose to put the english and 
german manual in html format there with a link, but this time without 
checkin in. Not too much traffic, I guess, and some seem to have 
troubles with kde-help. The manual itself is the best doc we have, and 
it's even good. And I could do it.

Best regards,
Georg.

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] noteedit-2.7.4 released
Message-ID: <421F4E19.4050506@schwaben.de>

Hi all,

the noteedit release 2.7.4 is now online. Please check it out and enjoy. 
Thanks everybody who contributed and made it possible! Svn is now widely 
open for improvements again.

Okay, I messed a bit around 'till I got the tarball up, even had to take 
my first one down again, so here is shown what's finally inside, also 
for future reference (it's a makefile extract):

B = noteedit-2.7.4
A = noteedit-2.7.4_beta1

build_tar_ball:
    rm -rf $B
    svn export svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/noteedit $B
    cp $A/configure.in         $B
    cp $A/Makefile.in          $B
    cp $A/acinclude.m4       $B
    cp $A/aclocal.m4            $B
    cp $A/configure              $B
    rm -f $B/Makefile.cvs
    tar cvf $B.tar $B
    gzip $B.tar

You see, I had a beta tarball around. I wonder only where the beta got 
these files from :)
For changes see the NEWS file and the website. Don't know how to tag svn 
version 60 with this release event.

Best Regards,
Georg Rudolph

Hi all,

from Stephan Binner I got this ./configure report:

checking for strip... (cached) strip
checking for Cygwin environment... (cached) no
checking for mingw32 environment... (cached) no
/bin/sh: admin/ltconfig: No such file or directory
configure: error: libtool configure failed
make: *** [configure-work/noteedit-2.7.4/configure] Error 1

I found out that in the admin directory some soft links where missing. Okay, I substituted already the tarball on the website with what I made now with this recipie:


B = noteedit-2.7.4
A = noteedit-2.7.4_beta1

build_tar_ball:
    rm -rf $B
    svn export svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/noteedit $B
    cp $A/configure.in    $B
    cp $A/Makefile.in     $B
    cp $A/acinclude.m4    $B
    cp $A/aclocal.m4      $B
    cp $A/configure       $B
    rm -f $B/Makefile.cvs
    cd $B/admin ; ln -s old-libtool.m4.in libtool.m4.in ; \
                ln -s old-ltcf-c.sh ltcf-c.sh  ; \
                ln -s old-ltcf-cxx.sh ltcf-cxx.sh  ; \
                ln -s old-ltconfig ltconfig  ; \
                ln -s old-ltmain.sh ltmain.sh
    tar cvf $B.tar $B
    gzip $B.tar


I hope not too many people got stucked with this. In the Suse 9.2 rpmbuild/spec build process these links seem not to be needed.

Best Regards,
Georg.

Subject: [Noteedit-devel] crash on midi import
Message-ID: <42234432.70803@schwaben.de>

Hi all,

midi import on my x68-64 box crashed. After a hunt, the attached patch 
will do the job for me again, so a real fix won't be too far :)

lastPlayableIdx seems to be a flag if lastPlayable->getMidiLength() is 
initialized or not. This bug might also have hit 32-bit builds, I guess. 
I created bug #3483.

Importing midi files from the internet or other programs is very 
valuable. We should increase the number of accepted tracks, find out how 
to quantize and document that more obvious.

In case you want to try it, here's how I do midi import:
    file -> new
    tse3 -> create tse3 song
    tse3 -> import midi, select a midi file
    tse3 -> tse3 to score
   
Or is there an easier way? Anyway, now it's even more fun.

Regards,
Georg
