<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> For rests, there is a common notation nowadays (and don't ask me why, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because it's stupid and harder to read IMHO) that if a certain 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> measure is empty (doesn't contain any notes), it has the whole rest 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which means that this measure is really empty (despite the actual 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> number of beats/length of the measure).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So r1 in a three beat bar should be accepted by lily 2.4.2, no 
</I>&gt;<i> correction in noteedit neccessary?
</I>
No, Lily wouldn't accept it (I tested with 2.4.2 and it doesn't work). 
Above, I only tried to explain how the notation usually looks nowadays 
(LilyPond output actually). But for Lily input, it's necessary to insert 
exact values (that is r2. (half dotted rest) for full measure length 
rest in 3/4 beat). I'm not aware of the NoteEdit bug, so I apologize for 
the misconception.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> LilyPond also offers a separate context for lyrics which is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> independent to actual staves, but can connect to certain real voices 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as well. I'd think more in that way. So we should have something like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Insert--Context--Staff
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>               --Lyrics
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>               --Chords
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>               --Tablature
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>               --GeneralBas markings
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>               --Harmonics
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Which is more or less the LilyPond syntax already. Applying certain 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Lyrics to voice as I said should be also possible if not necessary.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A few brainstorming ideas for the future:).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> About the mechanics of lilypond context I don't have a good idea yet. 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I'll post my proposal of the syntax template, and you might 
</I>&gt;<i> check it then ...
</I>
That would be a good idea. I'm working on a project of mine (still at 
blueprints and numerous tests, but thinking a lot:)) meant as a perfect 
composition tool. I've taken the concept of staves, lyrics etc. from 
LilyPond and I think it is the best around (comparing to Finale or the 
typesetting programs abc and musicxml). That's why I put so much 
preasure on this, because NoteEdit currently is very close to this 
perfect composition tool already (ie. the freedom  of inserting clefs, 
measure lines, MIDI commands, text signs) and I already made some good 
music with it. The downside of NoteEdit is however, ugly not-commented 
C++ code and KDE non-portability. But as this is free software, the 
first can be fixed, and the second is not conserning us as developers 
neither as composers.
