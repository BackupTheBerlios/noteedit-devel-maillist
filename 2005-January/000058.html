<PRE>Hi all,

I added export in lilypond-2.4.2 format, older versions are not 
affected/corrected at all. Lyrics get typset much nicer now.

Corrections were done in octave-lowered violin clef, syncing of lyrics 
with tie-melismas. Slur melismas still go out of sync, but they are not 
needed so heavily. This needs more investigation. A tempo assignment 
makes lily choking, needs maybe a newer lily. Export of drum note heads 
is incomplete. Whole bar rests in three beat bars (maybe only after four 
beat music) should be exported with r2., not r1.

And, we have a lot of if's in lilyexport. After the 2.4 release we 
should consider to drop support for lily 1.x. Any comments?

I'm considering to change the syntax of the score layout section that I 
can easily adopt the lilypond file to move the lyrics also above the 
notes. This syntax is a bit wired, but I think it might be good that 
noteedit gives in default already the hint how to do that.

What might be annoying: If there is no alsa-midi synthesizer up and 
running, noteedit is crashing without comment. This might scare people 
away. A printf somewhere is minimum, better a window in case you start 
through a desktop icon. Who might do that? If I'm more familiar with 
noteedit I will consider to work more with bug-assignment on berlios ...

Anyway, enjoy,
and Best Regards.
Georg Rudolph.
