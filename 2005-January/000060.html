&gt;<i> Hi all,

</I>&gt;<i> I added export in lilypond-2.4.2 format, older versions are not

</I>
Did you change the \version to &quot;2.4.2&quot; in the beginning of the export?

&gt;<i> Corrections were done in octave-lowered violin clef, syncing of lyrics 
</I>&gt;<i> with tie-melismas. Slur melismas still go out of sync, but they are 
</I>&gt;<i> not needed so heavily. This needs more investigation. A tempo 
</I>&gt;<i> assignment makes lily choking, needs maybe a newer lily. Export of 
</I>&gt;<i> drum note heads is incomplete. Whole bar rests in three beat bars 
</I>&gt;<i> (maybe only after four beat music) should be exported with r2., not r1.
</I>
I'm not sure how lyrics are treated in NoteEdit, but LilyPond has the 
following:
- every blank is a new note, multiple blanks one after another are 
ignored and are treated as one
- for melisma __ (double underline) is used, but doesn't take an extra 
note for that. eg. If you want to express &quot;Oh_______________ the days.&quot; 
(and Oh is melisma long 5 notes) in Lily, you make a slur (start of 
melisma) and on the note that starts the slur, you write Oh and then __ 
(means the start of melisma, the underline will hold until the end of 
slur) and later the days (two normal separated notes): Oh __ the days.
- if you want to divide a single word's sylables to more than one note, 
the -- (double dash) is used and again doesn't need an extra note for 
that. eg. If you want to express &quot;Li - ly - pond rules!&quot; (4 notes), the 
syntax should be Li -- ly -- pond rules!
- ties are treated the same as slurs; you can write melisma or treat it 
as a single note which doesn't need it

For rests, there is a common notation nowadays (and don't ask me why, 
because it's stupid and harder to read IMHO) that if a certain measure 
is empty (doesn't contain any notes), it has the whole rest which means 
that this measure is really empty (despite the actual number of 
beats/length of the measure).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And, we have a lot of if's in lilyexport. After the 2.4 release we 
</I>&gt;<i> should consider to drop support for lily 1.x. Any comments?
</I>
1.x is IMO dead for quite some time now. 3.0 is being actively developed 
in the moment (and the most exciting new feature that I'm waiting for a 
few years already is utf-8 support!:)), but is at least 6 months away.

&gt;<i> I'm considering to change the syntax of the score layout section that 
</I>&gt;<i> I can easily adopt the lilypond file to move the lyrics also above the 
</I>&gt;<i> notes. This syntax is a bit wired, but I think it might be good that 
</I>&gt;<i> noteedit gives in default already the hint how to do that.
</I>
LilyPond also offers a separate context for lyrics which is independent 
to actual staves, but can connect to certain real voices as well. I'd 
think more in that way. So we should have something like
Insert--Context--Staff
               --Lyrics
               --Chords
               --Tablature
               --GeneralBas markings
               --Harmonics

Which is more or less the LilyPond syntax already. Applying certain 
Lyrics to voice as I said should be also possible if not necessary.
A few brainstorming ideas for the future:).
