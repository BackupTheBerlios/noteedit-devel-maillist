<PRE>Hi Georg,

answers below (as far as I have them).

Regards, Leon.

&gt;<i> Hi Leon,

</I>&gt;<i> I appreciate very much your release proposals. That makes sense.

</I>&gt;<i> day, and it was very interesting, and fun.

</I>&gt;<i> lilyexport.cpp for lilypond &gt;= 2.4. I'm afraid to damage export for
</I>&gt;<i> older lily's, which I don't have nor test. Does anyone have a thought
</I>&gt;<i> about that? I think we should have two of them. lily develops nicely,
</I>&gt;<i> with many (small) changes.
</I>
That would probably be workable, but I suspect it would lead to a large code 
duplication. I am not fundamentally against that, but we should try to avoid 
it. Note that I don't have an easy way out either. The best solution depends 
on the amount of common code anyway.

Possible other solutions might be to put all the required if's in anyway and 
do regression testing to verify nothing is broken.

Or, do it the object-oriented way: create a LilyPond export class containing 
the common code, and use inheritance to support the differences required for 
the different versions. Never tried this myself, don't know if it would work.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the weekend I did some arranging, and suddenly triples input didn't
</I>&gt;<i> work anymore: It works only with mouse input, not by external midi
</I>&gt;<i> keyboard, or vkeybd, if you don't have a real one. Leon, could you look
</I>&gt;<i> at this, maybe?
</I>
For the time being I don't completely understand your problem. Is it releated 
to my triplet changes ? What exactly happens ? How can I reproduce it ? Could 
you send more info off-list ?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Something more: My devel machine is a suse 9.2 x64, and my build process
</I>&gt;<i> is adventerous. The suse provided noteedit-2.7.3 rpm builds by itself,
</I>&gt;<i> thanks. It includes a patch. This is my base. What works is 1) download
</I>&gt;<i> svn repository from berlios 2) apply the patch from suse rpm 3) workout
</I>&gt;<i> the commands according to the suse spec file. Although this beeing very
</I>&gt;<i> intuitive it gives me atleast a working noteedit. The documentation is
</I>&gt;<i> far from that. The bones of my script are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     cd noteedit
</I>&gt;<i>     cp /usr/src/packages/SOURCES/noteedit-2.7.3/configure.in .
</I>&gt;<i>     cp /usr/src/packages/SOURCES/noteedit-2.7.3/Makefile.in .
</I>&gt;<i>     patch -p1 &lt; /usr/src/packages/SOURCES/noteedit-2.7.3.dif
</I>&gt;<i>     cp /opt/kde3/share/apps/kdelibs/admin/acinclude.m4.in acinclude.m4
</I>&gt;<i>     libtoolize --force
</I>&gt;<i>     aclocal
</I>&gt;<i>     autoconf
</I>&gt;<i>     ./configure --prefix=/opt/kde3 --libdir=/opt/kde3/lib64
</I>&gt;<i> --with-qt-libraries=/usr/lib/qt3/lib64 \
</I>&gt;<i>         --disable-final --with-libtse3-libs=/usr/lib64
</I>&gt;<i>     make
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How should we deal with that magic? Should I try something? Maybe to
</I>&gt;<i> postpone it for later?
</I>
Would it help if we merged the Suse patch into the source tree, if possible ? 
Building the SVN tree is still an issue that should be solved IMHO. For the 
time being I also build by starting with the 2.7.3 tarball and adding the 
changed sources.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Georg.
