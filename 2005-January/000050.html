<PRE>Hi Leon,

I appreciate very much your release proposals. That makes sense.

I think the LAC in april in Karlsruhe is also an event to show noteedit 
is alive, and I hope to put a poster there. Last year I attended one 
day, and it was very interesting, and fun.

In my vacations I did some adaptions to lilypond 2.4 export. This gives 
nice lyrics printout, with many verses possible over and beneath the 
score. But instead of spreading many if's for the different lily 
versions, I propose to duplicate NLilyExport::exportStaffs() in 
lilyexport.cpp for lilypond &gt;= 2.4. I'm afraid to damage export for 
older lily's, which I don't have nor test. Does anyone have a thought 
about that? I think we should have two of them. lily develops nicely, 
with many (small) changes.

At the weekend I did some arranging, and suddenly triples input didn't 
work anymore: It works only with mouse input, not by external midi 
keyboard, or vkeybd, if you don't have a real one. Leon, could you look 
at this, maybe?

Something more: My devel machine is a suse 9.2 x64, and my build process 
is adventerous. The suse provided noteedit-2.7.3 rpm builds by itself, 
thanks. It includes a patch. This is my base. What works is 1) download 
svn repository from berlios 2) apply the patch from suse rpm 3) workout 
the commands according to the suse spec file. Although this beeing very 
intuitive it gives me atleast a working noteedit. The documentation is 
far from that. The bones of my script are:

    cd noteedit
    cp /usr/src/packages/SOURCES/noteedit-2.7.3/configure.in .
    cp /usr/src/packages/SOURCES/noteedit-2.7.3/Makefile.in .
    patch -p1 &lt; /usr/src/packages/SOURCES/noteedit-2.7.3.dif
    cp /opt/kde3/share/apps/kdelibs/admin/acinclude.m4.in acinclude.m4
    libtoolize --force
    aclocal
    autoconf
    ./configure --prefix=/opt/kde3 --libdir=/opt/kde3/lib64 
--with-qt-libraries=/usr/lib/qt3/lib64 \
        --disable-final --with-libtse3-libs=/usr/lib64
    make

How should we deal with that magic? Should I try something? Maybe to 
postpone it for later?

Best Regards,
Georg.
