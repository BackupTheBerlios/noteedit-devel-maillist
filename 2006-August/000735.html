<PRE>Hi Diogo,

&gt;<i> - PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND SCRIPTS: great to know
</I>&gt;<i> that we have all of these capabilities, C++, Ruby,
</I>&gt;<i> Python, without restrictions. Would it be helpfull if
</I>&gt;<i> I make a research about tools which could be included
</I>&gt;<i> in Canorus, including time relevancy? Or has anyone
</I>&gt;<i> done it already?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>My research wasn't directly connected to timing, I know it from
general experience and from my study. I looked for the script
languages and found ruby to be advanced over python in terms
of language concepts. About an hour ago I discussed with
Matevz about package delivery (i.e. on Win we need to include
ruby or python as well). Generally I've done some research in
tools (see the wiki, btw. you have an account there as well, the
default password is the same as your username but the first and
last latter are large. Please change it ASAP.
&gt;<i> - MY USERNAME IN BERLIOS: sorry, I must have thought I
</I>&gt;<i> registered, but now you can check again - my name is
</I>&gt;<i> there, now;
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Welcome as developer from Canorus :-) The Wiki contains several
informations about concepts and goals, a roadmap and what we
plan to have (at least) ready for the 1.0 version. I have to update
somewhen soon what we have already (or partially) implemented.

&gt;<i> - ABOUT FILE TYPES: well, you convinced me that it's
</I>&gt;<i> not possible at all to get Finale and Sybelius file
</I>&gt;<i> structures through legal ways, so I agree with you.
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, and I also agree that MusicXML is far more
</I>&gt;<i> interesting than other file formats, since it's much
</I>&gt;<i> closer to a universal format than the others! My
</I>&gt;<i> question: is MusicXML extensible? Can it support
</I>&gt;<i> integration of new musical score elements? I doubt it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't, but if does not, let me know...
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I'm not a real MusicXML expert, but XML generally
is expandable of course. But we have to be aware of
the fact that any extensions might be only useful in
Canorus itself if it won't get included into a new version
of the MusicXML standard.
&gt;<i> - FIREFOX PLUGIN: great to have support by Qt. Would
</I>&gt;<i> it be used by implementation of vectorial shapes or
</I>&gt;<i> mapped images? Or even fonts?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Yes, both Canorus and Muse score use it the way that
they render vector fonts. Matevz knows more details
about it (you can take a look at the source of course too :)
&gt;<i> - WEBSITE: well, I think it would be helpfull to have
</I>&gt;<i> nice layout site, but only if desired by the
</I>&gt;<i> administrators. It&#180;s not that hard to work out just a
</I>&gt;<i> little bit the menus, for example... we could use a
</I>&gt;<i> nice color combination, like the ones proposed by
</I>&gt;<i> professor Hideaki Chijiiwa of Musashino College of
</I>&gt;<i> Art, at &quot;Color Harmony - A Guide to Creative Color
</I>&gt;<i> Combinations&quot;, which is a nice book I've been reading
</I>&gt;<i> for site development purposes. If you give me an aval,
</I>&gt;<i> I can send you some suggestion by Thursday, when I get
</I>&gt;<i> home and have access to my design stuff. And what are
</I>&gt;<i> the content parts that need update?;
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Oh that remembers me on my first journal articles
about user interface development in a computer magazine
(quite good one from my actual experience point of view).
It pointed out the importance of color, shades and contrast.
As we are heading for music art this would really be a nice
touch. So be creative and show some examples. I have to
upload the homepages to svn but you should be able to
access it from your berlios shell account.

Thanks for the feedback!

Best,

Reinhard
